          </table>We look at enlarging and reducing images in various ways. The image remains intact and whole, but individual points of color merged or expanded to use up a smaller/larger canvas area. Note that while this is related to the resolution of an image (number of pixels per real world length), that is more a product of how the image is eventually used, and not a true concern of Direct Image Processing.

          <a name="resize" id="resize">
          <h2>Resizing Images</h2></a> The most obvious and common way to change the size of an image is to resize or scale an image. The content of the image is then enlarged or more commonly shrunk to fit the desired size. But while the actual image pixels and colors are modified, the content represented by the image is essentially left unchanged. However resizing images can be a tricky matter. It can modify images in very detremental ways, and there is no 'best way' as what is best is subjective as to what you actually want out of the resize process. Because there is no 'best' or 'perfect' way, there are a lot of options that you may like to consider. IM has always tried to provide options to give you the maximum scope of control in image resizing. There are hundreds of posiblilties, styles, and techniques, and even resize experts are consantally trying to find new and different ways of changing an images size. Of course for most people, the normal default options is good enough as they were designed with general use in mind. The resize operator has been very carefully designed to try to produce a very good result for real world images. That is, not to say you can't use it for diagrams, or line drawings, though for that type of image you may need to use some of the more advanced options we'll look at later.<br>
          The foremost thing you should consider when specifying an image to resize is...<br>
          <b>Do you really want to modify the image?</b> Resizing will cause drastic changes to an image, and avoiding or minimizing unwanted 'artifacts' is of greatest importance. Perhaps just a slight <a href="../crop/#shave">Shave</a> of the edges, or a more general <a href="../crop/#crop">Crop</a> of the image will produce a better and more desirable outcome than a wholesale resize of the image. It generally will look better and the area left will be a perfect copy of the original. Because it is often better not to resize images...
          <div align="center">
            <b>Resize will do nothing at all if the resized image is the same size.</b>
          </div>The exception to this (there is always an exception) is if you actually specify a <a href="../filter/#filter">Resampling Filter</a> using a "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?filter">-filter</a></code>" setting. In that case the normal "do nothing if image isn't resized" is overridden and the filter will be applied. However, many filters (even the default filters) can blur images slightly. It is part of their nature. So normally this 'short-circuit' for a no-op resize a good thing. The argument to the resize operator is the area into which the image should be fitted. This area is <i>not</i> the final size of the image but the maximum size of the area into which the image is to be fitted. That is, because IM tries to preserve the aspect ratio of the image more than the final (unless a '!' flag is given), but at least one (if not both) of the final dimensions should match the argument given image. So let me be clear...
          <div align="center">
            <b>Resize will fit the image <i>into</i> the requested size.<br>
            It does <i>NOT</i> fill, the requested box size.</b>
          </div>Aspect ratio is preserved basically so that any circles in the input image will remain a circle in the output image. That is, the image will not be squashed or squeezed, only resized, unless you tell it otherwise. For example, here I attempt to fit two source images, one larger image and one smaller image into a square box 64x64 pixels in size.

          </div>As you can see a 64x64 square image was <i>NOT</i> produced by "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?resize">-resize</a></code>". In fact the images were only enlarged or reduced just enough so as to best fit into the given size. <a name="noaspect" id="noaspect"></a> <b>Ignore Aspect Ratio ('<code>!</code>' flag)</b><br>
          If you want you can force "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?resize">-resize</a></code>" to ignore the aspect ratio and distort the image so it always generates an image exactly the size specified. This is done by adding the character '<code>!</code>' to the size. Unfortunately this character is also sometimes used for special purposes by various UNIX command line shells. So you may have to escape the character somehow to preserve it.

          Another commonly used option is to restrict IM so that it will only shrink images to fit into the size given. &nbsp; Never enlarge. &nbsp; This is the '<code>&gt;</code>' resize option. Think of it only applying the resize to images 'greater than' the size given (its a little counter intuitive).

          The inverse to the previous flag is '<code>&lt;</code>', which will only enlarges images that are smaller than the given size, is rarely used. The most notable use is with an argument such as '<code>1x1&lt;</code>'. This resize argument will never actually resize any image. In other words it's a no-op, which will allow you to short circuit a resize operation in programs and scripts which always uses "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?resize">-resize</a></code>". Other than that you probably do not actually want to use this feature. One such example of using this 'short circuit' argument is for the "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?geometry">-geometry</a></code>" setting of "<code>magick montage</code>".

          <h2>Other Resize Operators</h2></a> <a name="geometry" id="geometry">
          <h3>Geometry <font size="-1">- Resize just the last image</font></h3>Geometry is a very special option. The operator behaves slightly differently in every IM command, and often in special and magical ways. The reasons for this is mostly due to legacy use and should be avoided if at all possible. First, in "<code>magick display</code>" it is used to size and position the window of the image being displayed. This was its original usage and meaning when IM was first started. It was from this that its other 'resize' capabilities came about. For "</a><a href="../basics/#montage">montage</a>" "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?geometry">-geometry</a></code>" is a setting that is saved until all the arguments have been read in. At this point it then defines the final tile (cell) size (or leaves it up to "<code>magick montage</code>" to work out) while the position arguments are used to specify the space surrounding the tile cells. See <a href="../montage/#controls">Montage Control Settings</a>. In "<code><a href="../basics/#composite">composite</a></code>", "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?geometry">-geometry</a></code>" is also saved until the end of arguments have been reached. Then it is used to resize and position the overlay image (the first image given) before it is overlaid onto the background image (the second image). For example see <a href="../layers/#composite">Composite Multiple Images</a>. As you can see it is used as a 'setting' in most IM commands, but in "<code>magick</code>" "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?geometry">-geometry</a></code>" is both a special image resizing operator and a positioning setting. What it does is to "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?resize">-resize</a></code>" just the <i>last</i> image in the current image sequence. This is the <i>only</i> image processing operator that is designed specifically to effect just the one image (the last one), in the current image sequence. To complicate this special option further, the positional parts of the "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?geometry">-geometry</a></code>" option is saved by "<code>magick</code>" command, just as it is in "<code><a href="../basics/#composite">composite</a></code>". That is, any position is preserved for later use by the "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?composite">-composite</a></code>", to position the 'overlay' image, (the second last image in the current image sequence) over the 'background' image (the first image in the image sequence). For this reason, you should limit the use of "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?geometry">-geometry</a></code>" in "<code>magick</code>" commands to just before a "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?composite">-composite</a></code>" or "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?layers">-layers</a> composite</code>" operations. To summarize, this operator is only really useful after reading or creating a second image, just before you perform some type of <a href="../compose/#compose">Alpha Composition</a> to process with those images. For practical examples of using "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?geometry">-geometry</a></code>" to resize/position images see <a href="../layers/#composite">Compositing Multiple Images</a>. <a name="thumbnail" id="thumbnail">
          <h3>Thumbnail <font size="-1">- Resize with profile stripping</font></h3>The "</a><a href="../option_link.cgi?thumbnail">-thumbnail</a>" operator is a variation of "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?resize">-resize</a></code>" designed specifically for shrinking very very large images to small thumbnails. First it uses "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?strip">-strip</a></code>" to remove all profile and other fluff from the image. It then uses "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?sample">-sample</a></code>" to shrink the image down to 5 times the final height. Finally it does a normal "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?resize">-resize</a></code>" to reduce the image to its final size. All this is to basically speed up thumbnail generation from very large files. However for thumbnails of JPEG images, you can limit the size of the image read in from disk using the special option "<code>-define jpeg:size=</code>{size}" setting. See <a href="../formats/#jpg_read">Reading JPEG Images</a> for more details. As such this speed improvment is rarely needed for JPEG in thumbnail generation, though profile stripping is still very important. For other image formats, such as TIFF, both profile stripping and speed improvement is still vitally important. As such it is still the recommended way to resize images for thumbnail creation.

          <h3>Resample <font size="-1">- Changing an image's resolution</font></h3>Just as in the previous alternative resize operators, "</a><a href="../option_link.cgi?resample">-resample</a>" is also a simple wrapper around the normal "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?resize">-resize</a></code>" operator. Its purpose however is to adjust the number of pixels in an image so that when displayed at the given <a href="../basics/#density">Resolution or Density</a> the image will still look the same size in real world terms. That is, the given image is enlarged or shrunk, in terms of the number of pixels, while the image size in real world units will remain the same. It is meant to be used for images that were read in from, or will be written out to, a program or device of a particular resolution or density. This is especially important for adjusting an image to fit a specific hardware output device, whether it is a display, or printer, or a postscript or PDF image format of a specific resolution. Just remember the real world size of the image does not change, only its resolution and of course the number of pixels used to represent the image. For example, suppose you had an image that you scanned at a 300dpi (dots per inch). The image was saved with this resolution (density) or when you read it into IM, you specified it as a 300dpi image (using "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?density">-density</a></code>"). Now you decide to display it on a screen that has a resolution of 90dpi, so you do a "<code>-resample 90</code>". IM will now resize the image by 90/300 or to 30% of the images original size and set the images new density to 90dpi. The image is now smaller in terms of the number of pixels used, but if displayed on a 90dpi display will appear at the same physical size as the original image you scanned. That is, it now has a resolution appropriate for a 90dpi display, so it will be displayed to the user at its original real world size. A "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?units">-units</a></code>" setting (with arguments '<code>PixelsPerInch</code>' or '<code>PixelsPerCentimeter</code>') may be required in some situations to get this operator to work correctly. This setting can also be important for output to Postscript and PDF image file formats. Note that only a small number of image file formats (such as JPEG, PNG, and TIFF) are capable of storing the image resolution or density with the image data. For formats which do not support an image resolution, or which are multi-resolution (vector based) image formats, the original resolution of the image must be specified via the "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?density">-density</a></code>" attribute (see <a href="../basics/#density">Density Image Meta-data</a>) before being read in. If no density attribute has been set IM will assume it has a default density of 72dpi. Setting the density AFTER reading such an image will only affect its output resolution, and not affect its final size in terms of pixels. <a name="scale" id="scale">
          <h3>Scale <font size="-1">- Minify with pixel averaging</font></h3>The "</a><a href="../option_link.cgi?scale">-scale</a>" resize operator is a simplified, faster form of the resize command. When enlarging an image, the pixels in the image are replicated to form a large rectangular blocks of color. Which is great for showing a clean unblurred magnification of an image. For example, here is a magnified view of one of the built-in tile patterns...

          </table>When shrinking images, neighbouring pixels are averaged together to produce a new colored pixel. For example scaling an image to 50% of its original size will effectively average together blocks of 4 pixels to create a new pixel (assuming the image size is a multiple of 2 as well).Caution is advised however as a scale reduced image can also generate Moiré patterns, unless the new image is an exact integer reduction (a technique known as 'binning'), which also requires the original image size to be some exact integer multiple of the final size. Also a real-world photograph that has been heavily minified using "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?scale">-scale</a></code>" tends to look overlay sharp, with aliasing ('staircase') effects along sharp edges. The pixel averaging of "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?scale">-scale</a></code>" allows it to generate 'pixelated' images. You basically reduce the size of the image to average the pixels, then enlarge again back to the image's original size.

Rather than generate the colors based on a 'average of pixels', within the 'support window' it uses a more accurite 'area of pixels' within the support window.

It also shows how <a href="#scale">Scale Operator</a> is actually similar to that of a <a href="../filter/#triangle">Triangle Filter</a>, but only when doing very small downsizing of images. In other cases (strong downsize, upsizing, or exact interger sizing) it will produce results more like that of a <a href="../filter/#box">Box Filter</a>. Basically it generates something that is more like a mix between Box and Triangle filters depending on exactly how much the image is reduced in size. You see similar effects when enlarging.

          When enlarging a <a href="../filter/#box">Box Filter</a> will never produce 'averaged pixels', only pixel row/column duplications. Scale however will generate averaged color pixels along the edges, again much like but not exactly the same as a <a href="../filter/#triangle">Triangle Filter</a>. Of course this effect is only really visible for small, non-integer enlargements, and in larger scalings, only along edges where in a more typical case you may get one or two averaged pixels. In summary: <a href="#scale">Scale</a> is much much faster than the normal <a href="#resize">Resize Operator</a>, as it is less general in its image processing requirments. But it is also a completely different algorithm, producing a slightly different result when used to resize images using non-integer scales. For more detail see the <a href="http://entropymine.com/imageworsener/pixelmixing/">Pixel Mixing</a> page, as well as the IM Forums Discussion, <a href="../forum_link.cgi?f=1&amp;t=22345">Upscaling a few pixels linearly</a>. Special thanks goes to forum user <a href="../forum_link.cgi?u=23182">atnbueno</a>, who pointed out the above difference. <a name="sample" id="sample">
          <h3>Sample <font size="-1">- Resize by row/column replication/deleting</font></h3>The "</a><a href="../option_link.cgi?sample">-sample</a>" resize operator is the fastest resize operator, especially in large scale image reduction. In fact it is also even faster than the "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?scale">-scale</a></code>" operator (see above). When enlarging or magnifying an image it only performs does pixel replication (as per the <a href="../filter/#box">Box Filter</a>, generating rectangular 'blocks' of pixel colors. However when shrinking an image "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?sample">-sample</a></code>" simply deletes rows and columns of pixels. Because whole rows and columns of pixels are simply added or removed, "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?sample">-sample</a></code>" will generate no new or additional colors. This fact can be important for some image processing techniques such as resizing GIF animations. Another way of looking at it is that the image has single individual pixels 'sampled' in a very even regular pattern across the whole image. You can think of the image as being divided into an array of regions, and one pixel from each region is selected for the resulting image. However this 'sampling' of individual pixels (or wholesale row/column removal), can have rather horrible results, especially for images containing thin lines (in terms of width in pixels). For example, here I draw a line but then reduce the image size resulting in only a line of dots.

          <h4>Offset of the Sampled Pixel</h4>As of IM v6.8.4-7, the exact pixel being sampled in each sampling sub-region, is now defined as being the pixel at the mid-point of each region (or top-left center pixel if the sub-region is an even number of pixels). That means if you make a single pixel sample of an image, you will get the middle pixel of the image.

          </table>This type of information is especially useful for images that being reduced by an integer division of the original image size. Such as when you are creating or sampling a pixelated image, or</a> <a href="../video/#deinterlace">De-interlacing a Video Frames</a>. Also as of that version you can control exactly which pixel in each sub-region is selected using the <a href="../basics/#define">define</a> "<code>sample:offset</code>, which takes one or two percentage value(s) ('<code>50</code>' by default for mid-point). Note a percentage is used as the in the general case the 'sampling sub-regions' may not align with pixel bounds. That is, why it is a percentage is needed and not a 'pixel offset'. However if the image size is nicely divisible by the number of samples then you can easily calculate exactly which pixel you want from each sub-region. For example if an image sampled so that you have 5 pixel sub regions, then (For example, sampling an image that has 100 pixel across, down to 20 pixel samples), then you can use an sampling offset percentage in the range 0 to 19.9 to select the first pixel in each region, 20.1 to 39.9 for second, and so on. In other words you can use a percentage value of either 10,30,50,70 and 90 to exactly specify exactly which pixel you want from each constant sized sampling region.

This algorithm tries to smooth the corners of pixels being enlarged, without adding extra colors. As such very small pixelated images enlarge more cleanly, while retaining the original colors and a "retro pixel look" of the smaller image.

          <h3>Liquid Rescale <font size="-1">- Seam Carving</font></h3>Just as</a> <a href="#sample">Sampling</a> an image resizes by directly removing or duplicating whole columns and rows from an image, the special IM operator "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?liquid-rescale">-liquid-rescale</a></code>" also removes or duplicates columns and rows of pixels from an image to reduce/enlarge an image. The difference is that it tries to do so in a more intelligent manner. Firstly, instead of removing a simple line of pixels, it removes a '<i>seam</i>' of pixels. That is, the column (or row) that could zig-zag through the image, at angles up to 45 degrees. Secondly it tries to remove seams that have the '<i>least importance</i>' in terms of the image's contents. How it selects this is in terms of the image's energy, or more simply, the amount of color changes a particular 'seam' involves. The 'seam' with the least amount of changes will be removed first, followed by higher 'energy' seams, until the image is the size desired.

It also squeeze the right foot of the wizard slightly, producing a little jaggedness in the edge of the cloak, just as it did to the wizard's thin but simple wand. On the other hand the <a href="#sample">Sample Resize</a> image, simply removed equally spaced columns of pixels, which resulted in the whole image becoming equally distorted. The stars are not preserved intact and all the edges have distinct but uniform <a href="../filter/#aliasing">aliasing</a> effects. Basically "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?liquid-rescale">-liquid-rescale</a></code>" will produce a generally better looking 'squeezed' image without generating extra 'mixed colors' or blurring of the image. However you can get some slight but localized aliasing effects in one spot (the wizards wand in this case) rather than spreading that effect across the whole image. It will also expand images, by 'doubling' up the seams found within the image.

Though in this case the left most star and the 'm' becomes distorted as the 'seams' going through these 'low energy' regions become grouped together. Note however it will only double each seam once, and as such the technique starts to break down when images are expanded too much. A better method is often to resize the image larger first, then use liquid rescaling to reduce it to the desired size. Or to use "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?liquid-rescale">-liquid-rescale</a></code>" in multiple smaller steps. To show the effect of "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?liquid-rescale">-liquid-rescale</a></code>" better here is an animation, as the same image is resized down to a very thin image, then enlarged again. This animation was created using the shell script <a href="animate_lqr">animate_lqr</a>. <!--<CODE EXECUTE OUT=animated_lqr.gif>

          </div>Again notice how it tries to preserve the most complex parts of the image, as the image gets compressed into a smaller and smaller area. That is, the spaces in the title are preferentially compressed first, then the wizard's arm, then the right side of the wizard, leaving the most complex middle part of the wizard for the very end. Especially look at how the stars get pushed together before they are finally effected by the resampling pixel removal that liquid rescaling implements. (See problems next) You can think of liquid rescaling as trying to compress an image, like a sponge, with the open areas being compressed first leaving the bulky and more structured parts for last. <b>Seam Carving Problems</b>Liquid Resize, or Seam Carving, works purely by removing whole pixels from the image. As such, like <a href="#sample">sampling</a>, it will not generate or merge colors together, and straight lines and patterns within the image may become heavily distorted by the operation. Basically it can result in serious <a href="../filter/#aliasing">Aliasing Effects</a>, unless some method of smoothing is also applied. Generally however the aliasing effects will be grouped and localised to the less complex areas of the image rather then spread thought the image. this is the only reason it works so well! As a 'seam' can zig-zag through the image, the seams, can and often appear to go around complex objects, removing the space between the objects before attempting to compressing the objects themselves. Note for example how the word 'Image' in the above demonstration appears to get shoved under the other letters in the title without too much distortion. However this side to side movement limited to 45 degree angles. For images with 'busy' backgrounds, and less 'busy' foreground objects such as photos containing peoples faces, the energy function can assume that the foreground object is less important that the background. This results in some serious detrimental side effects, that may require human intervention to resolve.

          <h3>Distort Resize <font size="-1">- free-form resizing</font></h3>All the above resize methods all have one limitation which we touched on earlier, they will round the size of the new image to an integer number of pixels, then map the old image's pixels to the new pixel array. This has two effects. First when resizing to a very small size the X scale may not exactly match the Y scale of the resulting image (a slightly different aspect ratio). This difference is minor, and unless you get very small it is usually not noticeable. The other effect is that you cannot resize an image to fit an area that contains a partial pixel edge, which can be important in further processing, such image overlays. It also means you cannot use resize to just shift (translate) an image half a pixel to the right (without actual resize) even though the algorithm could quite easily do this. With IM v6.3.6 the</a> <a href="../distorts/#distort">General Distortion Operator</a> "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?distort">-distort</a></code>" will let you do this and more, using its <a href="../distorts/#srt">Scale-Rotate-Translate</a> distortion method. You can also do this using an <a href="../distorts/#affine">Affine</a> distortion based on movements of control points. Note however that because the edge of the image can contain partial pixels, the final image will probably be 2 to 3 pixels larger than you probably would expect. The extra surrounding pixels will be mixed according to the current <a href="../misc/#virtual-pixel">Virtual Pixel</a> setting, which you typically set to be transparent. For example, here I resize the rose image to 90% (<code>.9</code>) of its original size, without rotation (<code>0</code>), shrinking it around the center of the image (the default control point if not specified)...

Because of this the edges are fuzzy as the pixel colors are being spread over fractions of a pixel size, and not just to whole integers. Note that I used the 'plus' form of "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?distort">+distort</a></code>" to allow this image's processing operator to set the final images size and offset on the <a href="../basics/#page">Virtual Canvas</a> correctly, for further processing and layering.

That is, the distort is an exact re-scaling and positioning of the image to fractions of a pixel, allow you to fit it precisely into other images. This can become especially important when doing video work, where an imprecise resize of embeded images can produce 'jarring' effects.

          <h3>Resizing with Colorspace Correction</h3>While resize works very well, most people do not use it correctly. Even I normally just use resize directly on images, as is, and thus technically I resize images incorrectly. Images are typically stored using a non-linear "sRGB" colorspace, or with gamma correction. See <a href="../color_basics/#perception">Human Color Perception</a> for details. But resize (like most other image processing operators) is a mathematically linear processor, that assumes that image values directly represent a linear color brightness. The colorspace "sRGB" is basically contains a gamma correction of roughly 2.2. Actually it is more complex than that involving two separate curves. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB">wikipedia, sRGB</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/Color/sRGB.html">W3org, sRGB the Default Colorspace of the Internet</a>. As of version 6.7.5 ImageMagick follows this convention and defines the default colorspace of images (at least for most image file formats) to be sRGB. This means we simply need to use the "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?colorspace">-colorspace</a></code>" to transform the image to a linear space before doing the resize.

          </div>As you can see the 'lights' in the images are much much brighter as they are not so heavilly influenced by the non-linear colorspace of the source image. Though most images do not have as great an impact as can be seen in the above, it is present, and can have many effects. The main effect that can be seen from the non-linear effects of sRBG is that darker colors are saved as much darker values (so as to be more perceptually relevent. But as they are darker, they do not get processed correctly mathematically, so the resulting sRGB image is darker than an image processed in linear colorspace like RGB (or LAB or LUV). Also see <a href="../color_basics/#processing">Color Processing Real Images</a> and <a href="../draw/#colorspace">Drawing with Gamma and Colorspace Correction</a>. The same correct colorspace handling also applies to the use of distort (elliptical filter), image blurring, and can have great effects on image quantization, dithering and ordered dithering. This is looked at in detail in resampling filters. WARNING: RGB colorspace may produce clipping problems along edges involving strong primary color changes (not just between black and white).

          </div>An alternative to the gamma inverse operation "<code>-gamma 0.454545</code>" is to use "<code>-evaluate POW 2.2</code>". Note that gamma correction is only a rough match to properly converting images from/to sRGB colorspace, but it is so close that you would be hard pressed to see any difference between colorspace vs gamma correction. Gamma correction also does not play around with the IMv7 RGB/sRGB colorspace settings, so may be a better choice when the exact version may be unknown. You may also like to look at the "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?auto-gamma">-auto-gamma</a></code>" operator, which tries to adjust the image, do as to produce equal amounts of light and dark areas (assuming the image is in a linear colorspace).<br>

          <h3>Resizing in LAB colorspace</h3>One problem with using sRGB, RGB or even XYZ colorspace for resizing or for any sort of image processing is that the 3 color channels not only represent color but also intensity or brightness. That means that if one channel becomes distorted (such as by being clipped) the pixel color will also become distorted and can result in a funny look. The LAB colorspace is not only a linear colorspace, but was designed so that intensity (L channel) is separated from two color channels (A<sup>*</sup> and B<sup>*</sup> channels). That means that if any one of the channels becomes clipped, it does not generate color skew. It also means that generally none of the channels are actually close to clip limits unless you specifically deal with pure black and white images, which is uncommon in real life images. As such by processing images using LAB colorspace, actually works better, and avoids clipping and color skew, that you may get when using a RGB or XYZ colorspace.

              This meant that in older versions of IM, image processing in LAB colorspace did not work, especially when a color involving both positive to negative values were involved. That when working with colors that change between blue-yellow and red-green.<br>

          </div>As you can see while the edge of the rose was clipped in linear RGB colorspace, it was not clipped in LAB colorspace. In RGB colorspace the bottom edge of the rose sees a color change from near pure white to near pure red, causing a strong (negative) change in the 'green' and 'blue' channels. This produces a very strong 'negative lobe' ringing effect which is then clipped in RGB colorspace. The final result is a severe color distortion, due to the filters sharpening effect. In LAB colorpsace, the shift from white to red is not nearly as strong in either intensity or in the color channels, and so while we get good sharpening in the intensity, neither it nor the color channels is clipped, thus avoiding color distortion. The result is a far better resized image, with a more appropriate sharpening effect from the filter. Simply by separating intensity from color. <a name="resize_luv" id="resize_luv"></a>
          <h3>Resize using LUV colorspace</h3>As of IM v6.7.8-8 IM also implements a closely related colorspace LUV. They both designed to be perceptually uniform (linear), and even share the same critical intensity 'L' or 'Lighness' channel results, though calculate the color channels differently. The main difference is that LUV color axis were adjusted so as to have perceptually equal color deltas (color differneces), which results in a slightly different color scale to LAB colorspace, though intensity remains the same between the two. See <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams_chromatic_valence_color_space">Adams chromatic valence color space</a>. The results for resizes between LAB and LUV is practically identical.

For example, here is the results of resizing the "<a href="http://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/ve/1438/earth_lights_4800.tif">Earth's City Lights</a>" image in '<code>Lab</code>' colorspace.

          </div>The result is practically identical to what you get if you had resized directly in the perceptual sRGB colorspace. But is resizing in a perceptual colorspace really a bad thing? Really that is a debatable point. It seems avoiding color channel clipping, while color slew (unequal changes to differnet color channels) is less important But then a LAB and LUV images are linear, perceptually! As such perhaps blending colors (which is what the <a href="../filter/">Resampling Filters</a> actually do) in a linear-perceptual colorspace may actually be a good thing to do. Just one final point, sRGB is only perceptually-linear in intensity along the primary color components. It is not actually perceptually-linear in color, so it remains a bad colorspace to doing any form of image resizing. Nicolas Robidoux summed it up nicely with...

              If you think about it for a minute, this makes complete sense, because the perceptual colour spaces pack lots of bits at the darker end of the intensity spectrum, and "hollow out" the lighter end, so as to mimick the HVS (Human Visual System). So, 1 unit of dark overshoot gets you less "far" in sRGB than in linear RGB, but 1 unit of light overshoot gets you less "far" in linear RGB than sRGB.<br>

          </div>Essentially what the final example in the above does is to decrease the contrast of the image, compressing mid-tone greys into a tighter linear range, while bringing the extreme values further from the clipping edges, before resizing. It then removes that modification afterward. This in turn de-emphases the extreme effects of color values, while still allowing the filter to process the mid-tones, in a linear fashion, so as to reduce color distortions. In many ways this is similar to resizing images in the default non-linear sRGB colorspace (which is a far too common practice), but works equally well for both bright and dark ringing artifacts. That is, it is symmetrical over the whole range of color values, where as resizing in sRGB colorspace works only from the lower dark end of the color range (blue and green values in the above). That is, it is a much more controlled technique.It has also been commented that that this sigmoidal variation may only work well for enlargements. Also try different values for the sigmoidal contrast intensity (6.5 in the above) for different images. Remember, just as with every resize technqiue, the results are highly subjective, and may not be good for all image types.

          <h3>Unsharped Resizing (USM) <font size="-1">-- Photoshop Resize Technique</font></h3>Often resizing images (either smaller or larger) adds some fuzziness (<a href="../filter/#blurring">Blurring Artefacts</a> to the image. Because of this many people like to play around with the various filters (see <a href="../filter/">Resampling Filters</a>), to try and make the results sharper. But this can add other <a href="#artifacts">Resize Artefacts</a> to the image results. One method that is commonly used is to sharpen the image after resizing. Typically this is done using the special and weirdly named, <a href="../blur/#unsharp">Unsharp Operation</a>, which contains even more controls to control the quality of the results. For example, lets 'unsharp' the results of the very blurry '<a href="../filter/#spline">Spline</a>' filtered image...

          </div>As you can see sharpening the image after the resize improves the results. Looking at the stars and hat details in particular. You get a very good sharp image without any aliasing, ringing or even dimming of effects. While a <a href="../filter/#spline">Spline Filter</a> is not particularly good filter to begin with, this method of sharpening (actually 'unsharping') will work for ANY filter. It also provides more controls to fine-tune the result. In actual fact this is what '<code>photoshop</code>' does to improve the quality of its resized images, though I do not know what settings it uses for the <a href="../blur/#unsharp">Unsharp Operation</a>. A technique known as USM The "<a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>" default (radius=6, amount=0.5, threshold=0) for unsharp is equivalent to "<code>-unsharp 12x6+0.5+0</code>", and this is correct (other than ignoring that GIMP sets a hard radius at twice sigma). However remember you really do not need to specify the kernel radius in ImageMagick, so a value of "<code>-unsharp 0x6+0.5+0</code>" will work better. See also the IM forum topic <a href="../forum_link.cgi?t=23747&amp;p=100643">unsharp parameters in GIMP</a>. The post <a href="../forum_link.cgi?t=17926&amp;p68112">Image Resizing</a> suggests using "<code>-unsharp 0x0.75+0.75+0.008</code>" as being good for images larger than 500 pixels. While an Open Photography Forum discussion <a href="http://forums.dpreview.com/forums/read.asp?forum=1006&amp;message=40282142">Downsampling with ImageMagick</a> suggests "<code>-unsharp 1.5x1+0.7+0.02</code>".<br>

          </table>The solution is rather tricky, as the normal user requirement when resizing images is to fit the whole of an image into a given size. As the aspect ratio of the image is preserved, that leaves extra, unused space in the area you are trying to fill. Here we try to resize an image to fill a 80x80 box.

          </table>In the above we added a backdrop canvas to pad out the unused parts of the resize box to show the space we wanted the image to fill, but it wasn't filled, as it preserved the image's aspect ratio. Now if all your images are either landscape style (they are wider than they are high) then you can of course just resize the image to fit either the height or width of the area, then use "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?crop">-crop</a></code>" to cut the image to fit it exactly.

          </table>The problem is that, the above will only handle landscape style images. It will fail badly if the image is portrait style (higher than it is wide). This of course can be solved in a script by first getting the image's dimensions, and then picking the right method to fit the image into the space needed. But a better solution would be to have IM do all the work for all images. The solution within IM is to process the image by resizing each of the images dimension separately. Then picking the larger image of the two results. To make this easier, resize itself has a built-in test option which will only resize an image if that would make the image larger. This allows use a very nifty solution to our problem.

          </table>In the above, the second resize in the series will only resize if the width produced by the first resize was smaller than the area we are trying to fill. The specific order of the resizes (height first, then width) was chosen, as most images are photographs which are usually longer horizontally. With the above ordering, such a case will result in the second resize operation being skipped. If your images are more often portrait images (longer vertically) then change the arguments to resize the image by height first, then width. For example...

          </table>The result of both of these examples should be very similar, and the command will work for both landscape and portrait styles of image, though it works better for one sort. The biggest problem with this method is that the image is now being resized 2 to 3 times, producing extra blurring and other possible artifacts in the final result. To reduce this, the initial resizes are performed at double the final dimensions, which assumes the original image is at least 3 or more times the size of the final desired result. Not a problem for thumbnail production, but something to keep in mind.<br>

          <h3>Resizing Line Drawings</h3>Doing a strong resize of an image containing thin lines can represent a big problem... Resizing images to very small thumbnails, causes thin lines that are only a few pixels wide to fade and disappear into the background. This can get so bad that I have seen thumbnails of a line drawing which looked completely blank! That is, every detail of the original drawing 'disappeared', making the thumbnail rather useless. If this is problem there are a few techniques that can help...
          <ul>
            <li>Resize then adjust contrast to make lines more visible. Though this will make the lines more aliased (staircased). It also has limits to just how far this technique can be used.</li>
            <li>Blur and threshold the image (a method very similar to morphological 'dialate' or 'erode') so as to produce make single pixel lines about 300% thicker. Now after resizing by 1/3 the image will be smaller but the lines will remain just as strong and visible as before.</li>
            <li>Thicken lines using <a href="../morphology/#thicken">Thicken Morphology</a> techniques. You may like to do the resize in stages, thickening and resizing the image by 50% at a time until you get to the final size. Though as the spacing between the lines shrinks you may find you end up with more of a 'blob' than a line drawing. That is, you may get the opposite problem. Adjusting the ratio of thickening to resize however should produce an acceptable result.
            </li>
            <li>Separate the line edging in an image from the areas of solid colors, and resize each by different methods (lines using the above). Afterward the two parts can be merged back together again, allowing you to preserve the line edging of the image. This will in effect reproduce the effect you often get when resizing vector images.</li>
            <li>Convert image to a vector image, then resize. This can be tricky but also can produce the best possible result for resizing line drawings, with perfect anti-aliased (sharp) edges, and clear images.</li>
          </ul>If you come up with some other way of effectively resizing line drawings, or tried some of the above technqiues, please let me (and other IM users) know about it.
