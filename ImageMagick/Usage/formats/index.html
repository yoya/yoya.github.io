          <h2>A Brief Summary of Common Image File Formats</h2>For an introduction to reading and writing image formats see <a href="../files/">Image File Formats</a>. While a list of all the ImageMagick file formats are given on the <a href="https://imagemagick.org/script/formats.php">IM Image Formats Page</a>. Here is a very quick summary of the most common 'normal' image file formats, as well as their general advantages and disadvantages...
          <dl>
            <dt>
              <a href="#gif"><b>GIF</b></a>
            </dt>
            <dd>This format is extremely common, and has been around for so long that all image handling programs understand it. But only uses a limited number of colors (a 256 color table) and only saves using 8 bit quality. However its built-in run-length encoding allows it to save images with only a few colors very efficiently. While the format has transparency, it only understands Boolean (on/off) transparency and so consequently suffers from 'aliasing' or 'jaggies'. Plain text with thin lines suffers badly when saved as a transparent GIF image. The only solution to this problem is to tie the GIF image to a specific background of the web page in which it is used. The GIF format can save multiple images to form an animation sequence, and for this purpose also saves the image canvas size and offset (page) information. Note however that negative offsets are not supported, and attempts to do so resets that offset to zero. Its best used for small images of cartoons, line drawings, and small icons, all of which have limited colors, and will allow it to compress well. Its use however should be avoided when a newer format like PNG is available.</dd>
            <dt>
              <a href="#jpg"><b>JPEG</b></a>
            </dt>
            <dd>Does not handle transparency at all. The image is equivalent to using "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?alpha">-alpha off</a></code>" operation to remove the alpha channel, so any background transparency commonly becomes black depending on the image processing used to generate the image. This format is also 'lossy', producing edge effects on sharp lines and borders and thus should not be used for any intermediate image processing, or storage of image originals (unless they were already in this format). It is well suited to long term storage of real life photographs, but avoid it if you plan to further process the image, or the image contains large areas of solid colors.</dd>
            <dt>
              <a href="#png"><b>PNG</b></a>
            </dt>
            <dd>This format is intended to eventually replace older formats like GIF and TIFF. It is a modern format capable of handling 16 bit quality with four color channels allowing the full use of semi-transparent colors. It also includes a huge number of lossless image compression options. Its biggest disadvantage is that it is still relatively new, such that the Microsoft IE (v6) web browser does not automatically handle it correctly. However a fix is available for this problem. The format does not save canvas size information (where GIF does), but it does save the canvas offsets and even negative offsets (which GIF does not), though some web browsers have problems when a negative offset is used, so this is not recommended for a final image to be displayed in a browser. For saving intermediate 'layered' images, the ability to save negative offsets can be very important and is often much more important than its not saving canvas size information.</dd>
            <dt><b>MNG</b></dt>
            <dd>This is the multi-image format for PNG, and allows animations to movie quality levels and speed. <i>A simple example of using MNG is wanted, so if you have one mail me.</i> The MNG animation format appears to becomeing obsolete and has been abandoned by some web broswers such as FireFox.</dd>
            <dt>
              <a href="#tiff"><b>TIFF</b></a>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              This is the Image interchange format that was developed to transfer high quality images between programs before any serious image formats were available. Unfortunately, because of this beginning, the format has been modified with a haphazard array of features and compression styles and no programs understands them all. The format is now pretty well only use by "<code><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/">Photoshop</a></code>" on windows platforms, and this is the only source that provides any sort of standard reference for the TIFF image format. TIFF files can handle multiple images, though few applications other than IM handle multiple image TIFFs. Generally, unless the internal format of the TIFF image is kept relatively basic, there is no guarantee that a TIFF file generated by one program will be usable by another program, including IM or even "<code><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/">Photoshop</a></code>" itself. As such I do not recommend this format period! I suggest you use some other format than TIFF (or JPEG), especially for long term storing of images. The few notes I have on this format and its problems are provided below in the <a href="#tiff">Miscellaneous Formats, TIFF</a> section. These usage notes were found in the IM mailing lists and forums, as I myself don't use or need to use TIFF.
            </dd>
            <dt><b>Video Formats</b></dt>
            <dd>
              Other movie quality animation formats generally based on using lossy compression to reduce the size (and quality) of the movie. Both formats are in a constant state of flux, improvements and security limiting features, making any form of processing difficult. At last count there was more than 200 video format 'codecs' that are in general use for one purpose or another. Because of this IM does not directly handle this format, instead it relies on other software packages, to handling the processing of the individual frames into and out of the animations. These 'delegate' programs include "<code>mpeg2decode</code>", "<code>mpeg2encode</code>", and "<code>mplayer</code>". See <a href="#mpeg">MPEG, M2V, and AVI</a> below).

          <h2>GIF Image File Format</h2>The GIF format is a very widely known image file format, as it has been around for a very very very long time (from the late 1980's). It is often picked for images which are to be displayed on web pages that involve transparency or image animation. It is also about the only format absolutely universally understood by all web browsers. Unfortunately it is not a very good format for anything but line drawings, figures, diagrams, and cartoons. That is, because it is limited to a maximum of 256 colors, one of which is usually flagged as being transparent. Flagging one specific color in the image as transparent has some drawbacks. If the color to use as transparent is badly chosen, it can result in other parts of the image being transparent when that was not intended. Care must be taken to ensure that does not happen. Further more, the transparency ability is 'Boolean', which basically means it is either fully on, or fully off. Semi-transparent colors are just not possible, and if present need to be made either transparent or opaque. That means the format can not provide any form of anti-aliasing of edges of an image, usually resulting in a bad case of the 'jaggies'. (See <a href="../antialiasing/">Anti-Aliasing</a>) Because the "GIF" image formats color limitations causes so many problems, especially from a high quality image processing package like ImageMagick, I would like to say up front...
          <div align="center">
            <b>Avoid GIF format, if at all possible.<br>
            If you must use it, do so only as the final step.</b>
          </div>Finally for a long time the compression algorithm used by GIF was patented. Consequently it was not available for use by many image processing programs, such as ImageMagick. Thus very old IM programs will output GIF format images un-compressed, and thus using more disk space than it should. You can fix this using a GIF batch compression program such as "<code><b><a href="http://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/">Gifsicle</a></b></code>" or "<code><b><a href="http://utter.chaos.org.uk/~pdh/software/intergif.htm">InterGIF</a></b></code>". However as the patent expired completely in mid-2004, the current release of IM has the GIF image compression re-enabled again. The image compression is also rather simple, and works best on images with large areas of solid, unchanging colors. Or on simple repeated patterns of the same set of colors, such as you get using <a href="../quantize/#ordered-dither">Ordered Dithering</a> (not the default dither in IM). Finally GIF images can save multiple images in the one file. And this is used to generate <a href="../anim_basics/">GIF Animations</a> as understood by pretty well all web browsers, since the technique was first introduction by the very old "Netscape" browser. <b>In Summary</b> The GIF image file format with its limited color table, Boolean transparency, and simplistic compression (if enabled), makes it ideal for small images, such as thumbnails, and especially "cartoon-like" icons, logos, and symbols images with large areas of solid colors. Its animation abilities also make it an ideal method of generating flashy attention grabbing logos and advertisements you see all over the World Wide Web. For anything else its limitations make it a poor image file format and you may be better moving to JPEG, PNG, or a video image format for your needs. <a name="gif_colors" id="gif_colors"></a>

          </table>As you can see, a transparent grey color ('<code>#CCCCCC00</code>') was used for this image and this color has its own separate entry in the color table. You can also see that even though this image only uses 5 colors (one transparent), the color table used is for 8 colors. that is because the GIF file format can only use a color table that is a power of 2 in size. That is the color table is always 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 or 256 color entries in size. As such the last 3 color table entries are not used. Actually they are just not refered to. In some cases these unused entries may not be the last three entries in the color table, and could actually contain any color value. You can also actually have duplicate color values, though IM typically removes any such duplicate color entries if it processes the image in some way. As of IM version 6.2.9-2 (and in some older versions), IM will preserve the color table, and more specifically the transparent color value, whenever it reads, processes and writes a GIF image.

If you look closely you will also see that the image now has two '<code>wheat</code>' or '<code>#F5DEB3</code>' colors in its color table. That is, one transparent wheat and one opaque wheat. As of IM version 6.2.9-2, this presents no problem. Though only one transparent color can be defined by the GIF image file format. Why would you do that? Because some very old web browsers and graphic programs do not understand GIF transparency. So this option lets you set what color the transparent areas should be in that situation. Typical choices for the transparent color are '<code>white</code>' for modern browsers, OR more typically '<code>grey75</code>' ('<code>#BFBFBF</code>'), which was the original "<code>mosaic</code>" web browser page color. Other popular transparent color choices are '<code>grey</code>' ('<code>#BEBEBE</code>'), and '<code>silver</code>' ('<code>#C0C0C0</code>') which is what the 'hand' image above used. This shows just how popular that specific area of the gray-scale color range is for the transparent color. <i>FUTURE: add link to color selection.</i>

For example, here I draw a simple black circle on a transparent background. Also I will generate an enlarged view of the edge of the images, to make it clear what is happening.

However you now have control of the threshold level as you like. Thresholding the alpha channel at 50% works well for most types of images. Especially those with a simple edge, but the technique breaks down rather badly, when you need to deal with large areas of semi-transparent pixels.

          The first image is a normal save to GIF format, which as you can see thresholded the semi-transparent pixels at '<code>50%</code>', the second image was thresholded at '<code>75%</code>' allowing more semi-transparent pixels to become fully-opaque (or visible). If you just want to remove all the semi-transparent pixels (EG the shadow) you could try something like a "<code>-threshold 15%</code>", to remove just about all semi-transparent pixels.

          <h3>GIFs on a solid color background</h3></a> What we would really like to to somehow preserve the shading of the semi-transparent and anti-aliased pixels, and still display it nicely on the WWW. To do this we have to be a little tricky. The typical solution is to match the image to the background on which you are going to display the image on. This is simple to do, just overlay the image onto a background of the appropriate color, before you save it to the GIF format. This removes the need for any form of transparency and the whole thing becomes a non-issue. Of course the limited number of colors is still an issue, but often not a big problem.

Also after we are finished the image will not be much good on any other background. A big sacrifice to make. <a name="bg_pattern" id="bg_pattern">
          <h3>GIFs on a background pattern</h3></a> But what if you are using some pattern for a background, instead of a simple solid color? You could try positioning the overlay onto a copy of the background pattern so that the pattern in the resulting image matches the pattern of the web page. However that would require a lot of trial and error to get the background in the image to match up with the web page. Also you could only guarantee it to work for a particular browser, and then only that specific version of the browser. Not a good idea for a web page, so don't even bother to try. I certainly won't. Instead of trying to do a perfect match-up with the background pattern, lets just overlay it onto a color that at least matches the background we intend to use. For example lets overlay our image onto a 'typical' bubble like background pattern. But first we need to know the average color of this background. A simple way to find this color is to just <a href="../resize/#scale">scale</a> the image down to a single pixel, then read the resulting color.

Though the background color used matched the general color of the background pattern, it still has a very obvious rectangle of solid color, devoid of the the background pattern, around it. One practical solution is to declare the color we overlay, as the "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?transparent">-transparent</a></code>" color in the GIF output. By doing this we remove the 'squareness' of the image. Also adding a small <a href="../color_basics/#fuzz">fuzz factor</a> improves the result and adjusts the amount of space the transparent color uses, in the same way threshold did above.

In essence we are using the transparency to set a basic outline shape to the image, rather than a true transparency. By using a color for the overlay and GIF transparency so that it matches the background pattern means it is no longer clear exactly where the image stops, and the background pattern starts.<br>
          Be cautious however with the "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?fuzz">-fuzz</a></code>" setting, as too much and you can end up with more than just the outside of your image becoming transparent!

Of course if our image has 'holes' in it, then those holes will also have to be taken care of too. In which case the previous 'fuzzed transparency' may work better. Did say handling a GIF transparency color is easy! NOT!<br>
          An alternative technique especially for images with a sharp anti-aliased edge is to simply add a minimum outline of the background color. See <a href="../masking/#outline">Outline or Halo Transparency</a>.<br>
          <b>Remove the Background Color</b>... Trying an remove a specific background color from an existing GIF image is not easy. It is especially difficult if the overlaid image also contains the background color, as you then don't really know what is background and what isn't. The best solution is to get a copy of the same GIF overlay on two different and well known background colors. With two such images, you can recover the original overlay and all its semi-transparent pixels perfectly. See <a href="../masking/#two_background">Background Removal using Two Backgrounds</a>. If you don't have two such images, then you can not perfectly recover the images semi-transparency, but there are techniques that can do a reasonable though imperfect job. For this see the other sections of <a href="../masking/#bg_remove">Background Removal</a>.<br>

          <h3>GIFs for non-specific backgrounds <font size="2">(or Dithering the Transparency)</font></h3></a>
          <pre>FUTURE: This will move into a more generalise (non-GIF specific), alpha
dithering section.</pre>The biggest problem with the above is that it would only work if you happened to know exactly what color the background, or background pattern your image will be used on. If you don't know all is not lost. As you saw above, threshold does not work well for an image with a very large area of transparency, such as a fuzzy shadow. But another technique known as dithering can, and does NOT require knowledge of the background it will be used on. Basically dithering limits the transparency to on/off values, creating an effect of semi-transparency over a larger area using a pattern if pixels. In other words it fakes semi-transparency. This method was exampled in what is now known as the "<a href="http://pmt.sourceforge.net/opossum/">Opossum Examples</a>". Unfortunately these examples did not actually give the commands that were used to generate the example. For completeness I will attempt to demo them again here. The "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?monochrome">-monochrome</a></code>" operator converts all colors in an image into a pure black and white "Floyd-Steinberg error correction dither". However as it converts a grey scale image into just pure back and white colors we will need to extract an alpha channel mask from the image, dither that, and return it back into the image.

The '<code>checks</code>' pattern (first image on second line) is of particular interest as it is a very simple 3 level pattern that is very clean, and neat.

The big advantage of "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?random-threshold">-random-threshold</a></code>" however is the limit controls it provides.

          </table>You can improve the final look by using a darker mid-tone color (like a dark grey) instead of black for the shadow color. By doing this the color will tend to blur into the background more making the dither less pronounced that what is shown above. If you do know approximately what the background color is, you can even use a darker color of that shade to make the shadow bend in better without restricting yourself to the specific background shade. Sort of mix the two methods a little to improve the overall result. Basically The more work you put into what you want to do, the better the result will be.

          <h3>GIF Image Offset handling</h3>While the GIF format saves images with offsets as part of its image animation handling, it will not save a negative offset. Any attempt to save a negative offset to a GIF image will result in the offset being reset to zero. This can be a real pain when designing GIF image animations. If Internet Explorer web browser is given an GIF image whose 'page offset' places the image somewhere outside the 'page canvas size', it will ignore the page size and offset and display it as if it has no such offset. The ancient Mozilla web browser on the other hand will just display the image canvas, and apply the offsets to the image. This can result in an empty canvas being display with no image data present, which while correct, can be unexpected. Both will display the image using the page canvas size, with the appropriate page offset if the image is wholly contained on that page canvas. <a name="gif87" id="gif87"></a>

But if the image was a GIF animation, and was split up into separate images using +adjoin, Im would use the GIF87a, resulting in inconsistent results when displayed in web browsers. IM after v6.0.4 will always produce a GIF 89a image format file, unless the user specifically asks for the older "<code>GIF87:</code>" output format.</dd>

          <h2>JPEG Image File Format</h2>This format is about as common as the <a href="#gif">GIF format</a> above. But where GIF is designed with small simple "cartoon-like" images in mind, JPEG is designed for large real life images with lots of different colors, and shades of colors, such as photographs. A key feature of the JPEG file format is its compression, which reduces image size while keeping the image acceptable to the human eye. This is a very complex process and beyond the scope of this discussion. For more information about this process and its effects see <a href="http://www.photo.net/learn/jpeg/">Jpeg Compression Introduction</a>. And a great nitty-gritty explaination in the You Tube Video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2aEzeMDHMA">JPEG DCT, Discrete Cosine Transform (JPEG Pt2)- Computerphile</a> Unfortunately, to compress images well, the algorithm intentionally <i>loses</i> information. What is saved is <b>NOT</b> the same image as what is in memory; the color of a particular pixel or area of an image will generally will NOT be exactly the same color that was saved. This is particularly true near the edges of objects within the image. So as a quick word of warning...
          <div align="center">
            <b>IM is a general raster image processor, for modifying images.<br>
            It will not do lossless JPEG modifications.</b>
          </div>If you are interesting in lossless handling, see <a href="#jpg_non-im">Non-IM JPEG Handling</a>.<br>
          This lossy behaviour becomes even more noticable if a JPEG image is changed so that the amount of change to the top or left boundary is not a multiple of 8. When this happens the JPEG compression 'blocks' or 'cells' will be completely different, and that can produce a large increase in the final image save size. That is, operations such as chop, trim, shave, border, frame, extent, etc.. (See <a href="../crop/">Cutting and Bordering Operations</a> that can shift the image data by a pixel offset that is not a 8. See the IM Forum discussion <a href="../forum_link.cgi?f=1&amp;t=20415&amp;p=81480">Cropping an image result in an unexpected increased file</a> for more details.<br>
          Normally this <i>lossy</i> nature of JPEG data is not very noticeable. However it can become noticeable when you either load and save a JPEG image multiple times or use a very low quality with a diagram showing sharp color changes. However as long as you don't load or re-use JPEG images over and over (preserve and apply operations from the original source), it is still a good file format even image types it is not particularly good at handling. As an example of this lossy JPEG nature, here I generate a simple image of two gradients appended together. While the gradients provide a smooth color change that JPEG handles very well, the sharp color change between the two gradients are not handled well.

          </div>The first image is a magnified view of the undistorted GIF format version of the image (click the image to see or downlaod the un-magnified view). It only contains 20 colors, so in this case the GIF format can handle the image perfectly and actually generate a very small file size (see table below). On the other hand the JPEG version of the image shows clear color distortions that the JPEG compression added to the saved image, to allow it to compress it better. The distortions are greatest in the blue color channel, which is not surprising as blue is not resolved well by the human eye. That is, the human eye tends to 'spread out' blue colors naturally, so the JPEG algorithm takes advantage of this (by internally using a YCbCr colorspace). In fact without the magnification used above, you would be hard pressed to see the effect. Lets have a look at the effect of quality on the image.

          </div>If you look closely at first image result in the above, which we saved the test image at '<code>100%</code>' or maximum quality, there is still some slight color distortion. It is very hard to see, but it is present. On the other hand using a progressively lower "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?quality">-quality</a></code>" setting for the JPEG image makes this color distortion even larger and more noticable. Not only that it sets up a sort of 'shadowing' of the edges producing 'waves' of color changes spreading out from the sharp edges. An effect commonly known as <a href="../filter/#ringing">Ringing Artefacts</a>. However the reason for using compression is that the size of the resulting image is very dramatically smaller, at least initially. Here is a file list of the results and their size in bytes. <!-- <CODE EXECUTE NOIMAGE OUT=jpg_ls_lossy.txt>
  ls -lS --time-style=+ jpg_lossy*.jpg | awk '{ print $5, $6 }'

          </div>Note that the GIF image in this case is very small, as large 'blocks' of color compresses extremely well in GIF. As the JPEG quality gets lower, the size of the image also gets smaller. The default quality setting, when no JPEG quality is set, either by the user, or from the source image format file, is about 92%, which is a very high quality. However using a lower quality setting than '<code>50%</code>', image sizes do not get much smaller in terms of file size savings, only a much more progressively degraded image. It is a process of diminishing returns. In summary...
          <div align="center">
            <b>JPEG losses information, degrading images when saved.<br>
            Use some other format for intermediate images during processing.<br>
            Only use JPEG format, for the final image, not for further processing.</b>
          </div>JPEG is also not good for artificial images with sharp color changes, such as line drawings, diagrams, or cartoon-like icons, text, and symbols. Such images with a low number of colors are better saved using a palette image format, such as GIF, or PNG8. A new JPEG image format, Jpeg2000, is becoming available which does allow lossless JPEG compression. However this requires the 'JasPer' library to also be installed. To use this special format, you also need to use a "<code>-compress jpeg2000</code>" option or save to a JP2 file format, so IM will call the right library. <a name="jpg_trans" id="jpg_trans"></a>
          <h3>JPEG transparency - NOT</h3>Other than compression, the other major problem that JPEG users faces is that
          <div align="center">
            <b>JPEG does not save transparency</b>
          </div>Thus while you can overlay images onto a background color or pattern and save to JPEG, you cannot give a JPEG image a free-form border or with see-through holes. As JPEG was designed to save real world images, and not parts of images, as such transparency was not an issue it was concerned about, when the format was created. Consequently the designers never worried about including an alpha channel, or other transparency information in the file format. For example let take the PNG with transparency we used above and magick it directly to JPEG.
          <div align="center">
            <table class="table table-sm table-hover table-striped" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" width="90%" bgcolor="#F8F8F8">

          </div>As you can see all transparent parts just became black. But depending on the image source (especially GIF images) the transparent areas could have just as easily become some other random, or other inappropriate color. If this could be a problem the best idea is to have IM <a href="../masking/#remove">Remove Alpha Transparency</a>, before saving the image to the JPEG image file format. <a name="jpg_color" id="jpg_color"></a>
          <h3>JPEG Color Distortion (testing)</h3>As mentioned above, the compression algorithm JPEG used is lossy. That image will be modified to allow it to compress better, reducing file space, hopefully. Exactly how much color distortion occurs depends on the quality settings use. For example let us look at how many colors are in the IM built-in "<code>netscape:</code>" image...

                This setting is a hint to the JPEG image library to read just enough of the input (JPEG) image file to create an image that is at least the given size (width × height) or larger. If the input image is huge, this can greatly reduce the amount of memory IM needs for the image read, since IM will then be handling a smaller image. This, in turn, can dramatically increase the speed of the complete operation. Remember this is only a hint as the size of the image wanted, you are not guaranteed to get this size, just something close-to but larger than that size. Typically you will get something that is between this size and one twice that big, while preserving the images aspect ratio. Usually after reading a JPEG image with a size hint, the image is then immediately resized to its final 'exact' size. Typically using "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?thumbnail">-thumbnail</a></code>" to strip any image profiles, as well. For example...

                As JPEG does not save any form of transparency, when it is read in it will always be fully-opaque, and have not 'alpha' hannel in memory. This setting will force any JPEG image read in after the option to have a fully-opaque 'alpha' channel to be added to the image in memory. The better way to do this however is to use a "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?alpha">-alpha set</a></code>" or "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?alpha">-alpha</a> set</code>", after reading the image, as it will have less impact on the reading and writing of other image formats.

                Probably the more important option when saving JPEG images, as this controls just how much the image is compressed when save it to disk. The value is not a size percentage, just a quality value. The lower the value the smaller the image and the more image information is lost, producing more artifacts, and degrading the image.
                <pre>    FUTURE: VERY low quality example of a photo</pre>NOTE: a quality setting of '<code>100%</code>' is not guaranteed to save an image without any loss of quality, just a minimal amount of loss. (See the next option) NOTE: You cannot determine a quality to get a specific file size, except through trial-and-error. Start with a "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?quality">-quality</a></code>" of 75% and check the resulting file size. If it is too large, reduce the quality by 10%; if too small, increase. After you have a lower and upper bound on quality, do a binary search to find a quality that best matches your desired file size. A total of five or six trials should be sufficient.

              <dd>As of IM v6.5.8-2 you can specify a maximum output filesize for the JPEG image. The size is specified with a suffix. For example "<code>400kb</code>". It works by generating many versions of the JPEG image, doing a binary search, of the output quality "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?quality">-quality</a></code>" setting, until it gets as close as possible to the file size given without exceeding it. It does this by writing the image repeatably into a temporary file and once it has the appropriate quality size, it then outputs the final image to the given output filename, once. The output will thus still work fine when outputting the final image to a pipeline, or direct to network, and not just to a real file. However do not expect this process to be very fast due to I/O requirements. Perhaps 4 to 8 times slower. Mail me your results if you actually do a timing comparison.</dd>

              <dd>While a "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?quality">-quality</a></code>" setting of '<code>100%</code>' can still produce slightly different colors (it is still 'lossy'), the "<code>-compress LossLess</code>" option will ask the JPEG library to save the image without any loss of data. As such re-reading the image will restore should be exactly as it was saved. WARNING: This will only work if your JPEG library has been patched for 'LossLess JPEG' encoding, but the use of the JP2 file format has replaced this so this option rarely has any real effect anymore. Also you <i>MUST</i> also set "<code>-quality 100%</code>" for this to work. While intuitively you would think that saving with '<code>LossLess</code>' will automatically mean using a 100% quality, this is not the case. This is the result of tacking on an unusual patch for the JPEG image writing, which is a lossy format by definition. Of course the file generated will probably much be larger than a normal JPEG image. Also you will end up with a lossless compressed JPEG which you won't be able to read anywhere except with a similarly 'patched' JPEG library. As such 'lossless JPEG' is <i>NOT recommended</i> and some other format (like PNG or JP2) should be used instead.</dd>

Unfortunately some programs like Photoshop will ignore this setting if a density is also present in a special photoshop specific profile ('<code>8BIM</code>') stored in the image. Density is really only important when an output device is being used, such as printers or monitors, allowing these devices to display the image scaled to real world sizes. For example ensuring the photo or page you scanned is printed at the right size.

          <h3>JPEG Quality vs File Size</h3>The final file size of a JPEG file for a given quality is indeterminate. The whole process of compression is so complex with small changes producing wildly different changes to the compression. Its a 'butterfly-effect'. Even the same source picture with the same quality, but with different versions of IM, JPEG library, or other image processing programs, you will get very wide differences in file size, and observed quality. You may as well treat the quality setting as simple 'guess' as to how much compression or visual quality should be applied to a specific image. In essence it is a practical impossibility to pre-determine the final file size for a given image and quality setting... Except by actually doing it. IM however can do 'test runs' to discover the best quality to use for a specific file size by using the special '<code>jpeg:extent</code>' define. See <a href="#jpg_write">JPEG Write Controls</a> above. It is extremely slow, but faster than a similar DIY solution. Doing this is not recommended, and not just because it is slow. By your fixed file size method, a simple image might come out at quality 90%, but contain 50k of unnecessary data, where as a complicated image would have to drop to quality 30% and be exhibiting JPEG artifacts (or to put it less technically, it would look rubbish) due to a shortage of data for the detail present. The better idea is to find a single quality setting that produces an average file size of 100KB for a reasonable selection of your images. Even then images with not much detail in may come out at only 50k. While images with lots of intricate detail may come out at 150k, both will look acceptable. For a practical guide to the JPEG compression and quality, see <a href="http://www.ampsoft.net/webdesign-l/jpeg-compression.html">Optimization of JPEG compression settings</a>. Also see <a href="http://www.impulseadventure.com/photo/jpeg-compression.html">JPEG Compression, Quality and File Size</a> for a look at the JPEG internal details. <b>Photoshop Tip</b>: Photoshop will add about 4 Kbytes of extra information to JPEG images to hold previews and color management info (profile '<code>8BIM</code>'). If you do not want that information, use the 'Save for Web' function. This tip was found in a paper on JPEG compression by <a href="http://www.fho-emden.de/~hoffmann/howww41a.html">Gernot Hoffmann</a>.<br>

          <h3>Lossless JPEG Processing</h3>As decoding and re-encoding a JPEG image results in a degrading of image quality (unless lossless compression is used) the JPEG image library provides a number of special programs that can manipulate the image, without loss of quality. These commands will also be generally a lot faster than IM equivalents, as they do not have to do as much processing of the image. When modifying comments in JPEG images You can use the lower level JPEG library programs "<code>rdjpgcom</code>", "<code>wrjpgcom</code>" and "<code>jpegtran</code>". However I recommend you use "<code><a href="http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/jhead/">jhead</a></code>" program, as it preserves any profile or other information that is also present in the image. The "<code>jpegtran</code>" allows you to go further and actually losslessly manipulate image data, including 90 degree rotation, cropping, and drop-in. It Even allows the creation of mixed quality JPEG images. For a demonstartion of this see <a href="http://wiki.thorx.net/wiki/JPEGhack">JPEGhack</a> page by Nemo Thorx. (See the notes below) However these commands are <i>NOT</i> recommended for general use, as they are limited to the block boundaries (8 or 16 bit) of the JPEG image. That is, to say That is, you can only crop, rotate, or drop-in at a JPEG compression cell level, not at the actual pixel level.<b>Comments</b>... If you are creating <a href="../montage/#html">Montage Thumbnail Web Index Pages</a> of your JPEG photos, and like to use the comments you add to the JPEG files, using the above programs, use a "<code>-label '%c'</code>" to tell montage to use the 'comment' field, before reading filename on the "<code>magick montage</code>" command line. You can also use that comment in a <a href="../transform/#polaroid">Complex Polaroid Transformation</a>, or a <a href="../montage/#polaroid">Polaroid Montage</a> or some type of image <a href="../text/#annotate">Annotation</a>. The "<code><a href="http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/jhead/">jhead</a></code>" program be used to add or modify comments in JPEG image files. However I found using the "edit comments" ("<code>-ce</code>") option to not a good way to do that as it adds an extra newline to the end of the comment. This extra newline stuffs up the use of commands ('<code>%c</code>' label formatting escape) in IM. The better way is to use "comment input" ("<code>-ci</code>") to feeding in a comment (without newlines at the end), or the "comment literal" ("<code>-cl</code>") options to be a much better way...

From Rob, If you want more detailed editing of the profiles stored in JPEG image files, than what "<code><a href="http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/jhead/">jhead</a></code>" provides, have a look at more EXIF-centric applications of the perl based, "<code><a href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/">ExifTool</a></code>", an alternative compiled version "<code><a href="http://www.dalibor.cz/minolta/exiftool.htm">ExifTool</a></code>", and a Windows GUI "<code><a href="http://www.exifer.friedemann.info/">Exifer</a></code>", just to name a few. With the Image::ExifTool Perl module installed, this will strip out all JPEG metadata loslessly. I found the following to be equivalent to the command line method for stripping EXIF data.

See <a href="http://www.photopla.net/wwp0703/stripes.php">this site</a>. The solution provided by Yuval Levy &lt;imagemagick07_AT_sfina.com&gt; solution was to use "<code>jpegtran</code>" to insert a low quality JPG, into a high quality JPEG...
          <ul>
            The solution:
            <li>produce two versions of the same image with ImageMagick, one at the high quality 100 and the other at low quality 60 (for size reduction).</li>
            <li>use jpegtran to crop the q60, shaving off 8 pixels on each side</li>
            <li>use jpegtran to merge the q60 on top of the q100</li>
            <li>use jpegtran to merge to a stripe</li>
          </ul>Nemo Thorx &lt;jpeghack@nemo.house.cx&gt;, read the above and tried to implement Mixed JPEG quality. He succeeded and demonstrates the results on his Wiki pages at <a href="http://wiki.thorx.net/wiki/JPEGhack">JPEGhack</a>. Basically it is very posible to do lossless JPEG, processing such as 'cropping' and 'dropping' new sections of JPEG blocks into an existing image.

          <h2>PNG Image File Format</h2>This is one of the newest and most modern image formats, supporting 32 bit colors including alpha channel transparency, but can also be optimised to a GIF like 8 bit index color scheme (256 color limit). As such it makes an excellent intermediate format for image processing without loss of image information. <a name="png_quality" id="png_quality"></a>
          <h3>PNG compression</h3>When used with PNG output, quality is regarded as <b>two decimal figures</b>. The first digit (tens) is the zlib compression level, 1-9. However if a setting of '<code>0</code>' is used you will get Huffman compression rather than 'zlib' compression, which is often better! Weird but true! The second digit is the PNG data encoding filtering (before it is comressed) type: 0 is none, 1 is "sub", 2 is "up", 3 is "average", 4 is "Paeth", and 5 is "adaptive". So for images with solid sequences of color a "none" filter (<code>-quality 00</code>) is typically better. For images of natural landscapes an "adaptive" filtering (<code>-quality 05</code>) is generally better.

          </table>If you have an ImageMagick image with binary (on/off) transparency, the PNG encoder will write it in an efficient manner, using the tRNS chunk instead of a full alpha channel. But if any opacity value other than 0 or MaxRGB is present, it'll write a PNG with an alpha channel. You can force this behavior by using the "<code>-type TruecolorMatte</code>" image reading setting, or you can save the image using the "<code>PNG32:</code>" format file. An external program "<code><a href="http://pmt.sourceforge.net/pngcrush/">pngcrush</a></code>" or the newer version "<code><a href="http://optipng.sourceforge.net/">OptiPNG</a></code>" will attempt to re-compress a specific PNG for the best possible compression available, and is recommended for images that you plan to place on a web site. Another program "<code><a href="http://www.cybertherial.com/pngnq/pngnq.html">pngnq</a></code>" will color quantize it to a 256 color, 8bit PNG, though it is not known if this support semi-transparent colors in that format. <a name="png_compress" id="png_compress"></a>
          <h3>Better PNG Compression</h3>One point about PNG images is that PNG image will preserve the color of fully-transparent pixels. That is, even though you can not see it transparency has color, and PNG preserves that data. This means that in many cases PNG can be made to compress better by replacing that 'invisible color' with a static solid color, rather than garbage color that may be left over from previous image processing. There are two major methods you can use for this, using <a href="../masking/#alpha_background">Alpha Background Operator</a> to just handle fully-transparent pixels only, or using a <a href="../color_basics/#fuzz_alpha">Fuzz Factor with Transparency</a> type operation to also map near-semi-transparent colors to fully-transparent-black. For example, here I take the fuzzy shadowed "<code>a.png</code>" image we generated above and replace all pixels that are within 20% of full transparency.

          As you can see you get a substantial improvement in image size (around 50%). But with a sharp cut-off for the shadow of the image. Another alternative is to just make the shadow effect smaller, by adjusting transparency channel <a href="../color_mods/#level">Levels</a>.

          <h3>PNG, Web Browsers and Transparency</h3>The Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE version 6 and earlier) does not correctly display PNG when any sort of transparency is involved. Now while this is the most well known browser not to fully support PNG, it isn't the only one. The <a href="http://trific.ath.cx/web/png/">PNG transparency test</a> and <a href="http://entropymine.com/jason/testbed/pngtrans/">Another PNG test</a> pages will let you test your browser. They also list the browsers and versions that produce the results displayed. However as IE (at least at time of writing) is probably the most common browser, you can add to your web page a number of work-arounds to the problem. For information on this look at my WWW Laboratory Page <a href="http://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/anthony/wwwlab/pngtest/">PNG with Transparency and IE</a>, where I test and demonstrate the the "PNG in IE" solution I am using. Other solutions are to magick the PNG to either JPEG (with the right colored background), or GIF formats. These methods are discussed thoroughly for <a href="#bgnd">GIF Images on Backgrounds</a>. Another solution is to set the color of all fully-transparent colors in a image before saving it to PNG. PNG will save that fully-transparent color, but be warned that just about any other IM operation will reset fully-transparent back to fully-transparent black (as transparent color is not suppose to matter at that is the way image mathematics work).

          </table>Note however that this does NOT modify semi-transparent pixels, and these will still have their normal (non-transparent) colors without mixing that color with either the page background, or the color used for fully-transparency. As semi-transparency is no longer involved, borders can look jagged (aliased), as well as 'halo' effects, along lighter colored edges. For example look at the edges of the black and white circles which show the 'jaggies' aliasing effects. However using a gray replacement color should make this not as bad as as the original 'black' color used for full transparency. The other advantage of setting the color of fully-transparent pixels, is an improvment in compression of data. Sometimes, the underlying colors in transparent areas used during processing were preserved. These in turn do not compress as well as a solid color. As such setting the fully-transparent color as we did above, can produce a good saving in the final file size. However this should be done as a final step as many IM image processing operations will replace any fully-transparent color that is present in an image back into fully-transparent black. See the <a href="../masking/#alpha_background">Alpha Background</a> operator for a list of operators known to do this. My preference is for PNG display problems, is for Microsoft to fix IE, and it seems that IE version 7 will finally have a fully working PNG transparency handling, in all situations. <a name="png_offsets" id="png_offsets"></a>
          <h3>PNG and the Virtual Canvas</h3>While normally PNG will NOT save virtual canvas size information, it does save virtual canvas offset information, and if present, IM will try to generate a 'canvas size' that is appropriate for that offset and image size. This can be important to remember for some image operators such as "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?crop">-crop</a></code>", "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?trim">-trim</a></code>" and "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?flatten">-flatten</a></code>", etc., which make use of the images canvas or page size as part of its operation or results. Of course you can use the "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?page">-page</a></code>" setting and "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?repage">-repage</a></code>" operator, to set or remove the virtual canvas size and offset. (See <a href="../basics/#page">Page Image Attribute</a>). For example, the second IM "<code>magick</code>" sees the offset that is present in this PNG image, and defines a canvas that is large enough to ensure the image is visible within the virtual canvas bounds (Added to IM v6.1.7)...

              Add a raw PNG profile at location {x} from {file}. The first 4 bytes of {file} contains the chunk name, followed by a colon ':' character, and then the chunk data. The {x} can be 'b' to place profile before the PLTE, 'm' between the PLTE and IDAT, or a 'e' for after the IDAT. If you want to write multiple chunks of the same type, then add a short unique string after the {x} to prevent subsequent profiles from overwriting the preceding ones . For example..

              These are image 'properities' which are created by ImageMagick whenever it reads a file. They contain (respectively) the image files create time (actually permission/owner/move change time) and last file modification time. Unfortunatally PNG image file formats like to write such image data with the PNG image file format, and if this data is different, then the file generated will also be different, even if nothing else has changed.

          <h2>Image Profiles</h2>Handling profiles photo quality images is important, However from what I can tell this is a very magical art, and not simple matter. Not all formats use profiles, but most modern formats do. This includes JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and (as of IM v6.3.4-1) GIF. If fact the problem is exacerbated by the fact that many programs do not even understand or look for color profiles in images. <a href="http://www.snibgo.org/contact.htm">Alan Gibson, aka Snibgo</a>, put together a summary of how various web browsers handle various Color Profiles, on his own <a href="http://www.snibgo.org/improf.htm">Snibgo, ImageMagick Profiles</a> page.

          <h4>Color Profile Basics</h4>First a quick word...
          <div align="center">
            <b><a href="http://tinyurl.com/yr9mkt">Color Management is for Wimps</a> -- Don't Play with them<br>
            Messing with profiles generally makes things worse</b>
          </div>So if the colors look good... Leave it alone. An user <i>fhoech</i> in the IM Forums, (who has since disappeared) has quite a number of times posted the following basic introduction in using color profiles to change the color space used by images... The RGB, sRGB and CMYK are not colorspaces, they are color systems (which IM controls using the "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?colorspace">-colorspace</a></code>" operator). There is no single RGB or CMYK colorspace, but a literally infinite amount of different colorspaces are possible in each color system. You need ICC (or ICM) profiles which accurately characterize the colors in your images. Normally, the ICC profile that describes an image should be embedded in the image itself, otherwise, you have to use a 'best guess' attempt which is only a workaround: Open the image in an ICC-capable image editor and assign different ICC profiles (do not convert!) until you find one that looks OK with your image (your monitor must be calibrated so you actually get a good preview of the colors). Then, save the image with the profile embedded. As to why you need two profiles: The source profile describes the colors in your image as they are now. The destination profile describes the colors in the output image after conversion. Also, you should take great care when converting to a given destination profile: If, for example, you use a profile that describes offset printing on uncoated stock but intend to use the images for printing on coated paper, you will of course not get any good results. The output profile needs to be an accurate representation of your intended output condition. When converting from a subtractive into an additive color-space (or visa-versa) without using the correct profile (for both steps of conversion) you won't get 'correct' colors or brightness in most cases, although you may be lucky and hit the mark 'by accident'. You can download color profiles from <a href="http://www.color.org/srgbprofiles.xalter">International Color Consortium</a>. <a name="color_profile_changing" id="color_profile_changing"></a>
          <h3>Changing Colorspace via Profiles</h3>While you can just simple magick color spaces directly like this...
          <div align="center">
            <table class="table table-sm table-hover table-striped" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" width="90%" bgcolor="#F8F8F8">

              </tr>
            </table>
          </div>The best solution for converting CMYK to RGB JPEG is to use color profiles with the "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?profile">-profile</a></code>" operator. <i>Raf Lenaerts</i> pointed out the following rules in using the "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?profile">-profile</a></code>" operator within ImageMagick...
          <dl>
            <dd>If there is no embedded profile then the first "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?profile">-profile</a></code>" is the input profile. A second "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?profile">-profile</a></code>" then defines the output profile.</dd>
            <dd>If there is an embedded profile then a single of "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?profile">-profile</a></code>" operator will immediately define the output profile.</dd>
          </dl>In summary...
          <ul>
            <li>The "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?profile">-profile</a></code>" must be placed between the input and output file.<br>
              This is actually standard <a href="../basics/#cmdline">IM Command Line Processing Practice</a>.
            </li>
            <li>Use "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?profile">+profile</a></code>" with '<code>icm</code>' to remove any icc-profile present.</li>
            <li>The first "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?profile">-profile</a></code>" then given, is the input profile.</li>
            <li>The second "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?profile">-profile</a></code>" given, is the output profile.</li>
          </ul>As such to use profiles for ALL images, you will need three "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?profile">-profile</a></code>" operations: remove, input, and output profile options. For Example, If the input image already has a color profile then only one is needed.

          </table>Why is this important? Because IM is a 'raster image processor', and while it can read or write images stored in one of the vector formats it does so by converting the image to and from an internal raster image. Consequently if you are trying to magick an image from a vector format, to another vector format, IM will essentially rasterize this image at the currently defined <a href="../basics/#density">resolution or density</a> which will hopefully (but unlikely) be suitable for the output device you intend to use it on. In other words, any output from IM will never be a true vector format. While it can magick its internal raster format into a vector format file, the result is only a superficial vector image wrapper around an image in raster format. And unless the raster image is defined properly (at the right resolution) for the output device, the result will not be particularly good. Unfortunately new uses to IM do not know anything about this. They see IM as a converter that can magick say PDF to Postscript, producing images with 'blocky' aliasing effects, 'washed out' colors, or blurry images that just do not look good at all, on the intended output device. Which brings use to what I am trying to say...
          <div align="center">
            <b>Avoid using ImageMagick for 'Vector Image' to 'Vector Image' conversions</b><br>
            EG: converting between formats like: PDF, PS, SVG
          </div>
          <p>In other words, use the right tool for the right job. And for this situation, ImageMagick is not the right tool.</p>That is, not to say IM can't be used to do such a conversion. After all most printers and monitors actually rasterize the image themselves for the actual printing onto a sheet of paper. The difference is that the printer knows what resolution it needs for the hardware it is using. ImageMagick does not. For examples of converting vector images to rasters (and improving such conversions), see the example <a href="../text/#postscript">Postscript/PDF pre-formatted Text and Graphics Input</a>, and for SVG and user generated vector images see <a href="../draw/#svg">SVG Image Handling</a>. You may also find the information on <a href="../text/#pointsize">Font Size, Resolution and Pointsize</a> useful, particularly with regard to the effect of "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?density">-density</a></code>" on drawn text fonts.
          <h4>Non-IM Alternatives</h4>If you really do need to do general conversion between vector formats, the program <a href="http://sk1project.org/modules.php?name=Products&amp;product=uniconvertor">UniConvertor, Sk1 Project</a> (usually available as a standard linux package) and the <a href="http://scratchcomputing.com/projects/vectorsection/">VectorSection</a> can be used to magick vector-to-vector without actually rasterizing the images. For general conversion of Postscript to other vector formats, look at "<code><a href="http://www.pstoedit.net/pstoedit">pstoedit</a></code>", which is typically available in your systems extra package repositories. Also look at "<code><a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/epstopdf/">epstopdf</a></code>" which is part of the <a href="http://www.ctan.org/">Comprehensive TeX Network (CTAN)</a>. TeX and LaTeX are UNIX documentation (book and scientific article) text processing system. It has lots of tools to do with Postscript and PDF formats. For SVG to PDF conversion, Wolfgang Hugemann &lt;Auto@hugemann.de&gt; suggests that the easiest vector to vector conversion was to display the SVG in a browser (Firefox) and the print it using a PDF printer driver. Though the "Uniconvertor" could be used too.

          <h3>Postscript (PS, EPS) and Adobe PDF</h3>For basic handling see <a href="../text/#postscript">Postscript Text Handling</a> and the warning about <a href="#vector">Vector Image formats</a>. The major problem with Postscript and its related formats (like PDF) is that it is a complex page formatting language. That is, the format is a program and not really an image format! That means IM is forced to rely on another external program (or delegate) to 'run' the program and return the generated image.
          <h4>Encapsulated Postscript (EPS)</h4>Encapsulated Postscript is actually exactly the same as normal postscript (a vector image format) except it is a single page image, and a "Bounding Box' entry is present to define the exact area the image covers. The format was designed to to allow other programs to move and scale the image when inserting the postscript it defines into other postscript documents. IM handles it in basically the same way as postscript. (See above).
          <pre>  magick image.jpg -compress none eps2:image.eps</pre>Use "EPS2:" or "EPS3:" to create JPEG compressed EPS files: Note: Adding profiles to EPS images are on the 'to do' list but is currently not supported. <a name="ps_reading" id="ps_reading"></a>
          <h4>Postscript/PDF Input</h4>As this format is a vector image format it is effected by settings such as "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?page">-page</a></code>", and "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?density">-density</a></code>". Examples of reading Postscript (which is the same for EPS and PDF format) are provided in <a href="../text/#postscript">Postscript Formatted Text</a>, and you should read this first. However the reading of these formats is very complicated, as they are full computer languages designed specifically to generate a printed page on high quality laser printers. This is well beyond the scope of ImageMagick, and so it relies on a specialized delegate program known as "<a href="http://www.ghostscript.com/">ghostscript</a>" to read, and convert Postscript and PDF pages to a raster image. <b>One point.</b> As IM uses Ghostscript to rasterize a postscript file at a specific resolution, any raster images that are in the postscript file will often be blurred, or distorted, unless the exact density for that raster image is known. This also assumes that the postscript program itself does not rotate or otherwise manipulate the raster image. In fact, multiple delegates are present and selected by IM depending on the situation. For example the '<code>ps:color</code>' (using the '<code>bmpsep8</code>' ghostscript device) verses '<code>ps:alpha</code>' (using '<code>pngalpha</code>') is selected depending on if "<code>-channel RGBA</code>" had been set or not. The '<code>ps:color</code>' delegate is used rather than '<code>ps:alpha</code>' by default because the '<code>pngalpha</code>' ghostscript device only supports an one page/one image and PDF's generally are multi-page. Use "<code>-channel RGBA</code>" before reading the image to select the '<code>pngalpha</code>' delegate method. If all you want is the number of pages, using ghostscript can be a lot faster.

          <h5>Modifying the Input Delegate</h5>Modifying the system delegate is dangerous and a mistake could render IM unable to read postscript/PDF files. You also may need administration privileges, as you cannot replace a system defined delegate with a personal delegate, due to security ('hacker') measures. See <a href="../files/#delegates">Delegates and Coders for Image Formats</a> for more info on the delegate XML syntax and meaning, and creating personal input/output delegates. On the forum topic <a href="../forum_link.cgi?t=8546">Convert EPS to JPG Unreliable</a>, it was suggested that you edit your system "<code>delegates.xml</code>" and replace "<code>-sDEVICE=bmpsep8</code>" to "<code>-sDEVICE=bmp16</code>". Other users have found that changing this to "<code>-sDEVICE=pnmraw</code>", also works better. I have not tried this myself, so can provide no guarantees about this, or what versions of Ghostscript this applies to. If you have any further info, please let me know. If you have a CMYK postscript or PDF file then the page <a href="http://john.ukmn.com/2007/06/19/imagemagick-cmyk-to-rgb/">Blog of John</a> details how you can modify the delegate entry (Add a "<code>-dUseCIEColor</code>" ghostscript option) so ghostscript convert handles this this of postscript. Another possibility is to create a personal "<a href="../files/#delegate">Delegate</a> which would invoke pdftoppm. Say the tag is called "<code>pdfalt</code>" which invokes the program "<code>pdftoppm</code>" or even "<code>pdfimage</code>" from the "<code>xpdf</code>" package. Then your stream would look something like this:

          <h3>PDF Raster Image Extraction</h3>The rendering of any PDF pages to a specific size or 'density' is at the heart of the vector graphics using by PDF. It works great for text, or line drawings. But this also means that any raster image (pixel array) within the PDF has to be resized. But resizing is a 'lossy' operation, resulting in some image degrading, unless you use the original density of that raster image, which can vary from image to image within the PDF! It is thus advantageous to be able to extract the raster images from a PDF without any 'density' reference. You can extract the raster images directly using "<code>pdfimages</code>" program, which is part of either the <a href="https://poppler.freedesktop.org/">poppler-utils</a> or the "<a href="http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/">xpdf-utils</a> software packages. These software packages also contain many other tools that you can find useful for PDF processing. See <a href="http://blog.alivate.com.au/poppler-windows/">Poppler for Windows</a> and <a href="http://www.xpdfreader.com">Xpdf Reader</a>. You may also like to look at the "<code>mutool</code>" from the package "<a href="http://mupdf.com">MuPDF</a>" by the same people that look after GhostScript. An online tool to extract text and images is <a href="https://www.sumnotes.net/">Sumnotes</a> (commercial with limited free trial). At a lower level Wolfgang Hugemann says you can extract any image contained by a PDF (especially from PDF's generated by scanners). Basically by extracting any byte sequence between "stream" and "endstream", and saving as a separate file. <a name="pdf_text" id="pdf_text"></a>
          <h3>PDF Text Extraction</h3>You can use the GhostScript program "<code>ps2ascii</code>" or "<code>pstotext</code>". Or as an alternative that does both text and images, have a look at "<code>pdftohtml</code>" has an XML output that Ross Presser reports is "<i>pretty good at reassembling paragraphs.</i>". Also the "<code>pdftk</code>" program can 'uncompress' a PDF so it can be edited directly, and to 'repair' corrupt PDF's. <a name="pdf_options" id="pdf_options"></a>
          <h4>Postscript/PDF Output Options</h4>The following settings are known to effect the output of Postscript, Encapsulated Postscript, and PDF image formats: "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?page">-page</a></code>", "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?gravity">-gravity</a></code>", "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?compress">-compress</a></code>", "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?density">-density</a></code>", By default no compression is used on PDF image output, so PDF files can often be a lot bigger than necessary. The following table equated the IM compression modes with the resulting Postscript compression mode used. <a name="pdf_compression" id="pdf_compression"></a>

          </div>These two commands produce much smaller PDF files than a direct conversion, of a black an white page. However which is smaller depends on the image and is impossible to determine without trying and testing the resulting size. <a name="ps_alturnatives" id="ps_alturnatives"></a> <a name="pdf_alturnatives" id="pdf_alturnatives"></a>
          <h4>Postscript/PDF Output Alternatives</h4>Remember that PDF is a vector image (document) format, and IM is a raster image processor. This means that any PDF document IM creates will basically consist of a single raster image per page. The images output in the PDF document will be fixed at a specific resolution (or pixel density), which can cause pixel distortion issues when viewed or printed at some other resolution. Also for text documents, using a raster image is wasteful, as plain text with fonts and formatting meta-data will always be a lot smaller and render better than a scanned raster image of the text. Because of this, other PDF creation programs may be better suited to your needs. This will let you keep images as images, and text and text, allowing you position the text and images together in a nicer more logical way, as well as insert text, and overlay arrows or connecting lines, in a more logical fashion. For example I suggest you look at the support programs provided by the TeX and LaTeX system. See <a href="http://www.ctan.org/">Comprehensive TeX Network (CTAN)</a>. Another tool set is <a href="http://multivalent.sourceforge.net/Tools/">Multivalent Document Tools</a>. Of course such programs are harder to automate, however I have in the past use the simple FIG vector graphic file format (see <a href="http://www.xfig.org/">Xfig</a>) to generate Postscript and PDF documents with text and graphics placed in an automatic way. <b>Image to PDF convertors</b>... The tool <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sam2p/">sam2p</a> which is specialized in converting images to PDF files.

          <h3>PbmPlus / NetPBM Image File Format: <font size="-1">PBM PGM PPM PNM PAM</font></h3>The PbmPlus or "<a href="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/">NetPBM</a>" image manipulation filters (unix command line). These image formats come in a variety of styles "<code>PBM</code>" (bitmap), "<code>PGM</code>" (grayscale), "<code>PPM</code>" (color), "<code>PFM</code>" (floating point, for HDRI), "<code>PAM</code>" (arbitrary format), and "<code>PNM</code>" (any NetPBM format). Each of these (except "<code>PAM</code>" and "<code>PFM</code>") can also be either in a 'raw' binary form (the default when writing by either IM or NetPBM) , or as plain ASCII text format, (set using "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?compress">-compress</a> None</code>"). IM can of course read any of them. The format should be regarded as using "linear-RGB" colorspace only, and NOT using "sRGB" as most other image file formats. However a depth of 16 should be used when using "linear-RGB" so caution is recommended to avoid heavy round off errors with depth 8 images. The NetPBM formats typically saves one image per file. However IM, and many other NetPBM utilities will read and write files with multiple images simply concatinated together. As such when writing images it may be a good idea to set the appropriate "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?adjoin">-/+adjoin</a></code>" setting when writing files. (See <a href="../files/#adjoin">Writing Multiple Image Sequences</a> for details). The PPM file format is actually especially important to ImageMagick as it is the communication format used during the conversion of Postscript and PDF images via the "<a href="http://www.ghostscript.com/">ghostscript</a>" delegate. It is also a major format for video image processing such as from the "<a href="http://ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a>" command. Any 'quality' or value range can be used on input (up to 16 bit or 65535 'depth'). For example, here is a highly unusual value range of 5, to generate a 'step gradient'. I know of no other image format that allows you to use such an odd-ball quality range.

The above also demonstrates just how useful the 'ASCII' sub-formats can be. Espectally as a way of added images into shell scripts, or as a means of generating images from an array of numbers. For example see <a href="../files/#txt">TXT: Enumerated Pixel Format</a>.

          <h4>PbmPlus/NetPBM vs ASCII Data Format</h4>Its ASCII output is probably the cleanest method of extracting the color values from a specific image, which again makes it idealy suitable for script and simple image processing.

          </div>Note that when the output is plain text, and lines are not written so as to line up with the images row length. But you can re-format the output using the various UNIX text utilities. For example you can use the "<code>tr</code>" text utility to replace and compress multiple commas and spaces to single newline, will place all values one value per line, making it easier for a script to process. Also with IM you can only specify 'depth' of 8 or 16 for the output quality for PGM and PPM. While the PbmPlus formats allows the use of any 'maxval' for its values, even one that is not a power of two! It does have a hard limit of 16 bit depth (maxval 65535). A finer control of the actual 'maxval' of the NetPBM image is currently not possible, though could be added via a special coder setting in the future. (if requested). Here is another example outputing a 9x9 array of grayscale values from 0 to 255, extracted from the rose built-in image. I used "<code>pnmtopnm -plain</code>" so we get a newline at the end of each pixel row.

Check your NetPBM packages man page, as the developers can't seem to make up their minds as to how it should be done. Any of these PbmPlus programs will output a newline at the end of 'image row', which the ImageMagick coder does not do. This can make image processing in scripts a lot easier. Here is an example of outputing a very small ASCII PBM bitmap.

Also note that for bitmaps white='<code>0</code>' (background) and black='<code>1</code>' (foreground). This is a standard for bitmaps formats like XBM and PBM, and ImageMagick understands this convention. If this is not desirable <a href="../color_mods/#negate">Negate</a> the image, or use <a href="../color_mods/#level-colors">Level Images by Color</a> to set the desired colors of the bitmap image. <a name="pbmplus_depth" id="pbmplus_depth"></a>
          <h4>PbmPlus/NetPBM Depth Control</h4>Sometimes you want more control of the depth of PGM and PPM images, for example to use a percentile range of values from 0 to 99. One method is to use the NetPBM program "<code>pamdepth</code>", which can magick images to any range (up to internal limits of 65335). Here for example is an image array of values but using a 0 to 99 range of output values.

          <h4>PbmPlus/NetPBM vs ImageMagick</h4>The PbmPlus/NetPBM image processing suite was once a rival of ImageMagick for command-line image processing, but uses a completely different (more low level) pipeline filtering philosophy, for image handling and processing. This makes it easy to use in shell scripts, but more difficult to use for general or very complex image processing. It also means the image is converted to and from the image file format a lot more frequently, and generally requires the use of many temporary files. PbmPlus/NetPBM images do not generally deal with Transparency (though the newer PAM format does), and does not provide a general way of passing image meta-data with the image data. All the PbmPlus/NetPBM formats (like the ImageMagick internal format, see <a href="../files/#miff_stream">MIFF Image Streaming</a>) can handle a stream of multiple images, simply by concatenating or appending the images together, one after the other. This makes it very well suited for pipelined, multi-image streaming, methods of image processing, such as for video processing. However be warned that some PbmPlus/NetPBM programs only deal with single images and will not handle a stream of multiple images. However as it is more low-level, and pre-dates ImageMagick, it is often selected for raw image outputs such as video image output and handling. PbmPlus images is also more often used for scientific data, and as such images are typically stored as 'linear-RGB' colorspace rather than the more common non-linear 'sRGB' colorspace. Caution is advised. Both packages can co-exist, and I have been known to use a PbmPlus/NetPBM implementation for some things, instead of ImageMagick. Typically when using a specific low level image processing, or scripting using arrays of values stored in an image form. The two packages work together well, and recommend both be installed and used for serious image work.

  its variations.  Photoshop however has the best chance at reading it.

  I would steer clear of the TIFF image file format unless you are
  specifically working with photoshop, or the application accepts no other,
  better defined, image file format.

  I don't use the TIFF image file format, or Photoshop. If you use this format
  with IM extensively, perhaps you would like to submit your findings to me,
  to include here.  That way you  can help your fellow TIFF users.

  Whether a specific software package can read a TIFF, all you can do is try
  it and see.  That is, the problem with this format.



  TIFF and Density (resolution) in photoshop...

  See <a href="../basics/#density_photoshop">Photoshop and Density</a>
  for the details and solutions to this problem



  JPEG to TIFF conversion...

    magick image.jpg image.tif

  This will either save the image inside the TIFF file using JPEG compression
  (which was inherited from the JPEG input.  Or it will error such as...

      Error: "JPEG compression support not configured"

  This is caused by the TIFF library not including JPEG compression support.

  Either way  THIS IS BAD.

  You can get around this problem by changing the setting to use a different
  compression algorithm:

      magick image.jpg -compress zip  image.tif
      magick image.jpg -compress lzw  image.tif
      magick image.jpg +compress      image.tif

  WARNING:  -compress Group4  with a TIFF works, but ONLY if you remove all
  transparent and semi-transparent pixels from the image.  Typically you can
  make sure this is done the same way as JPEG images above, using
     -background {color} -alpha remove
  See <a href="../masking/#remove">Removing Transparency from Images</a>
  just before the final save (the first only works for single images).

  Enden and fill-order
    The order in which TIFF data values are stored is controled by
       -endien                   Global order of the bytes
       -define tiff:endian       Tiff format container endian
       -define tiff:fill-order   Bit order within a byte

    Each takes a value of either MSB (default) or LSB, however
    the "tiff:fill-order" will be set to the value of "tiff:endian"
    if that is defined, but not from the global endian value.

    The "tiff:endian" property is the endianess of the image container. The
    "-endian" property is the endianess of the image pixels. They may differ.


  Save a TIFF file format with only one row pre strip

          -define tiff:rows-per-strip=1.
    To save more rows per stripe increase the number
          -define tiff:rows-per-strip=8
    You can also specify the 'endian' ordering for binary integers in the format
          -endian MSB          -endian LSB

    For smaller TIFF images (other than by compression, you can also try to
    use options and settings like   -depth 8   to reduce the color quality
    or   -alpha off  to remove the alpha or transparency channel from the image.

    IM will save a greyscale image as a greyscale TIFF, if no non-grayscale
    colors are present. You can force it to save as non-greyscale with
          -depth 8  -type TrueColor


  Added IM 6.6.4-3
    Allow you to set the "Software Creation:" meta-data (property)
    to something other than "Image Magick 6.**"
        -set tiff:software "My Software"


  Windows Picture and Fax Viewer, Windows Explorer

    These can can only display TIFFs that have certain Photometric
    Interpretation values, such as RGB.  IM Options...
        -compress LZW -type TrueColor

    toggle the photometric interpretation  (Added IM 6.3.2-10)
        -define quantum:polarity=min-is-black
        -define quantum:polarity=min-is-white


  Multi-Page TIFF
    If you want to split a multi-page tiff into separate pages, IM may have
    problems as it will still use up a lot of memory to hold previous pages
    even if you use a command like...
        magick "a.tif[i]" b%03d.tif

    This might be regarded as a bug, or perhaps a future improvement.

    The better solution may be the non-IM "<code>tiffsplit</code>" program.


  TIFF and EXIF profiles

    Cristy reported: The libtiff delegate library supports the EXIF profile
    but it was unreliable and caused faults too often so we commented out the
    call.

    To get the EXIF attributes try this.

      magick identify -verbose -define tiff:exif=true image.tif

</pre>The TIFF format can have a bitmap mask in the form of a clip path, which can be enable using the "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?clip">-clip</a></code>" operator. You can use that 'clip' mask your image with that path using...

          <h3>BMP, Windows Bitmap</h3>
          <pre>
  The Windows desktop icon image format BMP (short for bit-mapped) is a very
  unfriendly image format and should probably be avoided if possible.

  ImageMagick supports 8, 24, and 32-bit BMP images.

  Add -colors 256 to the end your command line (before the output image
  filename) to create a 8 bit colormapped BMP image rather than a 24 bit BMP
  format.  Extra colors can be added to images after performing operations
  like rotates, and resize.  See Color Quantization for more info on -color.

  The presence of any transparency controls whether it uses a 24 (RGB) or 32
  bit (RGBA) format BMP image. You can use "-alpha off" to turn off transparency
  in an image.

  If all colors are gray-scale a 'directcolor' greyscale image is generated.
  I think -type truecolor will stop this behaviour.


  If you have an older program cannot read the default BMP4 images written by
  ImageMagick, (for example a Windows Background Image), you can enforce the
  generation of a BMP3 format image using...

       magick image BMP3:image.bmp

  This format should have no transparency and should be a 'printable image',
  whatever that means.  In other words 'Windows' compatible.

  However, if a PNG input file was used and it contains a gAMA and cHRM chunk
  (gamma and chromaticity information) either of which forces "magick" to
  write a BMP4. To get a BMP3 you need to get rid of that information. One way
  may be to pipeline the image though a minimal 'image data only' image file
  format like PPM and then re-save as BMP3.  Messy, but it should work.

      magick image.png  ppm:- | magick - BMP3:image.bpm

  IM can not produce BMP's at depth levels other than 8.  However you can
  use NetPBM image processing set to do the final conversion to other depth
  levels (This needs at least a Q16 version of IM)...

       magick image -alpha off -colors 16 ppm:- |\
         pnmdepth 4 | ppm2bmp &gt; image.bmp


  Format limitations....

  The header for a BMP2: format only allows the description of the width,
  height and bit depth (bits per pixel) of an image. The bit depth can be one of
  1, 4, 8 or 24.

  For comparison, the bmp3: format allows bit depths of 0, 1, 4, 8 ,16, 24 and
  32 and has extra fields which specify x and y resolution (in pixels per metre)
  and compression of the image data.

          <h3>RAW Camera Image Formats (CRW,CR2,NEF,X3F,etc.)</h3>Most digital cameras, with the exception of the Sigma Foveon sensor and some Sony cameras, magick the image produced by the lens into digital data by using millions of sensors which detect the brightness of one specific colour, Red, Green or Blue. In order for the camera to respond to colour in approximately the same way that the human eye does, there are twice as many green sensors as there are of red or blue because our eye is much more sensitive to green light. The sensors are arranged in what is called a Bayer array. For a description and diagrams of this arrangement see, for example, <a href="http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/camera-sensors.htm">Understanding Digital Camera Sensors</a>. The conversion of the data from a Bayer array into the more familiar RGB pixels requires a process called demosaicing. Once this operation has been done we still do not have an image worth displaying. Even with the extra green pixels, the camera's sensor still does not perceive colour the way we do. If you take a piece of white paper and look at it in bright sunlight and then go indoors and look at it under a fluorescent light, it will look white under both conditions. But if you photograph the sheet of paper under those same conditions using default camera settings, the paper will show slightly different colours when displayed on a screen. The reason is that although the back of our retinas will "see" the same light reflected off the paper as does the camera, our brain will interpret that light for us and we will perceive the paper as white. The camera simply measures the amount of red, green and blue light reflecting off the paper and under a fluorescent light there will be more blue light than there is under sunlight so the paper in that image will look bluer than the one taken in sunlight. To produce images which both show a white sheet of paper requires that they be "white balanced", also referred to as gray balanced or colour balanced. For more about white balancing see <a href="http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/white-balance.htm">Understanding White Balance</a> There are still other aspects of the raw file which must be done, such as setting a correct gamma, but without going into further detail it is clear that the raw file needs a lot of processing before it can become an image that we can view on a monitor. Camera raw files are often referred to as digital negatives. If you take a photo and have the camera generate a JPG image, it will have done the demosaicing and all the other adjustments. But if, for example, you forgot to set the correct white balance in the camera before taking the photo, you can't really do much with the JPG to correct the situation because so much information about the original image has been lost. If, on the other hand, you had produced a raw file from the camera instead of a JPG, during the conversion from raw you can choose a particular white balance setting along with other parameters and if the resulting image doesn't look right you can go back, change the settings and magick it again until it does look right. This is similar to the ability to produce more prints from film negatives. Without the film negative you wouldn't be able to get an 8x10 blowup of one of the 4x6 snapshots you get when the film was first developed. While ImageMagick can handle a large variety of different formats, it does not 'know' how to magick raw camera files, so IM uses the "<code><a href="http://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/">dcraw</a></code>" program as a delegate program to magick the raw file into a format that it does understand, either a TIFF (with the '<code>-T</code>' flag) or PNM. Note that it is designed for raw <i>camera</i> images, and not those from, for example, a scanner. The "<code><a href="http://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/">dcraw</a></code>" program can handle a large number of different raw formats including those from cameras manufactured by Canon, Fuji, Kodak, Nikon and Sony. You can determine whether "<code>dcraw</code>" will recognize your raw files by asking it to identify a sample. For example the command:
          <div align="center">
            <table class="table table-sm table-hover table-striped" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" width="90%" bgcolor="#F8F8F8">

</code></pre>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>
          </div>Which returns...
          <div align="center">
            <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" width="90%" bgcolor="#F8F8F8">
              <tr>
                <td>
                  <pre><code><font size="-1">CRW_9641.CRW is a Canon EOS 10D image.</font></code></pre>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>
          </div>When IM calls dcraw to do a conversion, using the <a href="../files/#delegate">delegate</a> (list using "<code>-list delegate</code>"), specifies two flags which affect image processing:
          <div align="center">
            <table class="table table-sm table-hover table-striped" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" width="90%" bgcolor="#F8F8F8">
              <tr>
                <td>
                  <pre><code> dcraw -w -4 -O output_file input_file
    </code></pre>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>
          </div>The '<code>-w</code>' flag means that dcraw will use the white balance information in the raw file if it can be found. If the info can't be found, dcraw will use an average of the whole image as a basis for white balancing. The '<code>-4</code>' flag means that dcraw will only de-mosaic and white balance the raw photo and output the result as a <i>16-bit linear image</i> (48 bits per pixel), suitable for the default Q16 version of IM. Because '<code>-w</code>' and '<code>-4</code>' are the only two image processing flags specified, there are some defaults that dcraw will use. The output colour space will be sRGB and no ICC profiling is done (on my system, dcraw was compiled without the LCMS library so it can't do profiling). The fact that the '<code>-4</code>' flag is set means that many processing steps have been omitted, including levels adjustment and gamma correction, and so the resulting image <i>will look dark</i>. The intention is that the user is going to process the image with an image editor such as "Photoshop" or "Paint Shop Pro", or even "ImageMagick" and do their own adjustment of the levels, gamma and so on. In this case, the image should be output to a format that supports 16 bits per colour. (For example <a href="#tiff">TIFF</a>). <i>Note</i> that just because dcraw produces a 16-bit file doesn't mean that all 16 bits contain useful data. For example, a raw image from a Canon 10D digital SLR has 10 bits per colour. More recent cameras by Canon and other manufacturers have 14 bits per colour. If you want your raw photos converted completely you will have to remove the '<code>-4</code>' flag so that dcraw does the de-mosaicing, white balance, brightness and gamma correction and so on. In this case dcraw outputs an <i>8-bit file</i> (24 bits per pixel). If you are going to do further processing of this image it would be best to output it as a <a href="#png">PNG</a> and avoid the <a href="#jpg">JPEG compression artifacts</a>. The JPEG format should only be used as a final step for actual use. In fact, it is always a good idea to use a lossless format such as PNG (or IM internal format MIFF) for intermediate steps in image processing. A special <a href="../files/#delegate_dcraw">DCRaw Delegate</a> can be added which will let you control how you read the 'raw' camera image formats. For further information look on the <a href="http://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/">DCRaw WebSite</a>, and also the <a href="http://www.guillermoluijk.com/tutorial/dcraw/index_en.htm">DCRaw Tutorial Website</a> which has some information about many of dcraw's optional flags and including histograms of raw images using various flags.

          <h3>MPEG, M2V and AVI Movies</h3>
          <pre>
  IM is not very efficient at creating movies.  It will do the job though
  requires the external program "mpeg2encode" to do much of the dirty work.

  The problem is that IM is not designed to handle video, but static images or
  small sequences of images.  That is, not to say it can't do it, but that is
  not its goal.  In particular it generally reads in all images into memory
  and process them from there.  For a large or long video this is not very
  efficient.

  For processing on a small sequence of frames however it really can't be
  beat.  In fact just about every Linux Video manipulation program uses
  ImageMagick to generate titles, fancy scene changes, and other effects to
  complete the post-processing development of a larger video development.  The
  process however is kept to small video sequences.

  However lets have a look at what IM can do.

  <b>Frames to Video</b>

  There are some reports that unless the images are the right aspect ratio is
  correct this will fail on older mpeg players,  use the MPEG II extension
  (m2v:) instead.

  Also use m2v to avoid heavy compression pixelization that can occur
  using...

      magick *.jpg glacier.mpg

  EG instead use...

      magick *.jpg m2v:glacier.mpg

  Note you may need lots of temporary space to do a large animations
  You can specify a different directory from the normal /tmp using...

      setenv MAGICK_TMPDIR /data
      magick -limit memory 0 -limit map 0 *.jpg image.m2v

Alternatives...

  To converting PNG images to MPEG2 Video streams, instead of MNG Multi
  PNG-files, use the following delegation...

       png2yuv -j file%08d.png -I p -f 25 -b 1 | \
         mpeg2enc -f 3 -q 3 -b 5000 -o out.m2v

  For more info see <a href="http://mjpeg.sf.net/">mjpeg.sf.net</a>


  IM forums reported decent results with an open source project called "<a href="http://ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a>", which seems to be a fairly standard
  linux package install.

     ffmpeg -f image2 -i %03d.jpg -vcodec mjpeg -y anim.mpg

  It probably has extra options I don't need but it makes a nice time-lapse
  from .jpg files.


  Dean S. Messing uses transcode...

     find . -type f -name '*.png' | sort &gt; filelist
     transcode -x imlist,null\
            --use_rgb\
            -y raw,null\
            -f 60\
            -i filelist\
            -g 4096x2160 \
            -j 540,1024,540,1024\
            -o video.avi\
            -H 0

   You can leave out -j  (clip window) if you want. -g is output size.

   Wolfgang Hugemann suggests a new alternative known as 'VirtualDub' under
   Windows Vista, which will let you run a video, or magick directly from
   a folder of image frames.

   WARNING: "<code>mplayer</code>" apparentally does not like mpeg file with
   only one frame. "<code>ffplay</code>" however seems to have no problems.


   <b>Video to Frames</b>

   Both "<code><a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/">mplayer</a></code>" and
   "<code>mencode</code>" are more efficient at converting video into a series
   of frames than IM is.  On top of this is can handle just about any video
   (and audio) codec available.

   For example to grab 5 frames from 1 1/2 minutes into a video, scaled to
   320x240, you can use...

      mplayer file.mov -vf scale=320x240 -ss 01:30 -ao null \
              -vo png:z=3 -frames 5

   Other alternatives include the "<code><a href="http://ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a></code>" open source library, though that is also part of the
   "<code><a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/">mplayer</a></code>" handling.

          <h3>DPX, Digital Picture Exchange Format</h3>This format is used in Motion Picture and Effects industry that makes particular use of the extensive header information and the format's flexibility in being able to handle high dynamic range and logarithmic colour values at a variety of bit depths using RGB or YCbCr pixel descriptions. It is based on, but largely supersedes, Kodak's Cineon format that has more a more film specific header. One example of it's use would be when scanning film for use in post production. Each frame would be stored as an individual .dpx file ranging from 2k (2048 pixels wide) to 8k (8192 pixels wide - for IMAX frames) at anything between 8 to 64 bits per colour component. A sequence of these might then be processed using compositing software, altering the colour or adding visual effects. Once complete they might then be recorded digitally to tape or projected back on to film. The colour values for each pixel are often stored logarithmically (particularly if the sequence is destined to be transferred back on to film) which more naturally reflects the density of how colour information is stored in the emulsion on the original film. When viewed without alteration logarithmic files appear to have very low contrast, and so require a 'look up table' to translate the logarithmic image to something that resembles what you might see if the image was transferred back to film and projected in a cinema. Apart from making the image linear (like most typical computer images) and adjusting the gamma level this table sets where the black and white point lies. For a 10 bit logarithmic image where each colour component value ranges from 0 to 1023 the black and white points are normally set at 95 for black and 685 for white. What this means is that the logarithmic file stores colour values that are lighter than what the linear version will display as pure white and darker than what it will display as pure black. This extra information therefore remains available for an effects artists who might wish to alter the brightness of the image after it has been stored as a dpx file. As an example, had this information been lost, reducing the brightness of an image uniformly would result in highlights becoming darker, whereas with this extra information the highlights instead reduce in size and start showing details that were previously too bright to be seen. The latter is far closer to what happens in the real world. The header can contain Film and/or Television specific data related to a production. For example the television header can contain a SMPTE time code so that shots exported as a dpx sequence from a production's edit can be easily replaced once any effects have been added. The film header holds information about the reel of film the frames originated from and various camera settings that were used while filming. All these details will then stay with the images as they are passed between post-production companies.
          <h3>Adding a time code to DPX files</h3>You can add a time code to any dpx file using the following:
          <div align="center">
            <table class="table table-sm table-hover table-striped" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" width="90%" bgcolor="#F8F8F8">
              <tr>
                <td>
                  <pre><code>
  magick -define dpx:television.time.code=10000215 \
          originalFile.00001.dpx    alteredFile.00001.dpx
</code></pre>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>
          </div>Carrying out this command for each of several thousand files that form a sequence from a film or animation would clearly take a very long time. A simple script can be used with ImageMagick to automatically increment the time code for each frame in a sequence. For example see the Perl Script <a href="../scripts/dpx_timecode.pl">dpx_timecode.pl</a>.<br>
          A copy of the above was added to the main IM documentation at <a href="http://magick.imagemagick.org/script/motion-picture.php">Introduction to Motion Picture Formats</a>. The above is courtesy of Seth Dubieniec &lt;seth.info_AT_dubieniec.co.uk&gt;, from a long IM Forum Discussion on the DPX Format. He is currently developing DPX applications, so more DPX info is likely to be coming.
          <pre><b>Extra Notes (unformatted)...</b>

Adding  -depth 10  causes IM to output a  10 bit DPX file.
-- James Fancher


If you want to set the gamma, for example, in the output DPX image...
     -define dpx:television.gamma=1.7

The colorspace of the DPX image is defined by the image element descriptor and
transfer-characteristic. If the transfer characteristic is
PrintingDensityColorimetric we set the colorspace to LogColorspace. Only if
the colorspace is Log do we apply the gamma and black/white points to convert
to the RGB colorspace. Its possible the program you are using is not
conforming to the SMPTE standard or ImageMagick is not interpreting the
standard correctly. Post an URL to your two DPX images and we will download and
try to determine if ImageMagick has a bug or if the program you are using is
buggy.

The following will work with ImageMagick 6.3.8-3

  magick -colorspace log AfterEffectsFile.dpx -set gamma 0.5 \
          -set reference-black 95 -set reference-white 685 image.jpg

Alternatively, take a look at the SMTPE documentation

You can add text user data to the dpx file by using

  magick image.dpx   -set dpx:userdata "some text"    new.dpx

          <h3>PSD</h3>A PSD image file is the Photoshop Working image file format, just as XCF is the GIMP working file format, and <a href="../files/#miff">MIFF</a> is ImageMagick's own working file format. They usually contain multi-images, with first image being an all-in-one merger of the current working image. That makes it useful for seeing the working image as it currently stands and is typically used for 'thumbnailing'. All the other images in the multi-image file format are the images that are used to generate that first combined image. That is, the individual working layer images, the user was working on at the time it was saved. So if you just want the 'final' image I suggest you append a "&nbsp;<code>'[0]'</code>&nbsp;" to the input filename to junk the working images, and just use the all-in-one first image. However if you plan to work with the individual layer images then use "&nbsp;<code>'[1--1]'</code>&nbsp;" to skip the first image. If no extra layer images are found than the first image will be returned instead. I do NOT recommend using "<code>-delete 0</code>" as that will return no images at all if no layer images follow that first image. Extra notes... If you can provide more information or like to submit a summary of using IM for this format, then please do...
          <pre>
   For PSD with a CMYK image you may need to get IM to use the
   right provide when converting (make sure you IM was installed with the LCMS
   delegate library) ....

     magick Test_CMYK.psd -strip -profile USWebCoatedSWOP.icc \
             -profile sRGB.icc Test_RGB.png

   See <a href="#profiles">Profiles</a> above for more info.


   If a PSD image contain a 'preview' image.  This image is returned as the
   last image of a two image read.

   To ensure IM never reads the last image use...
       magick test.psd[0--2] -flatten test.jpg
   That is, read all images, except the last. But always read the first.
   This can not be done after the read using a "-delete".

          <a name="html" id="html"></a>
          <h3>Webpage Conversion to Image (HTML)</h3>If IM loads a HTML it will look for a html2ps to magick the html to postscript which it can then render as an image. This does not work very well, but does work. Using a full web browser is a much better method as it is designed to do the task in the best possible way. The simplest method to use a browser is to just load the page in a browser and then take a screen shot of it. This gets a perfect image of the page but limited to the window size of the browser. Another variation is to have the browser output the page as postscript rather than have IM magick it. This should page the website into smaller pages quite nicely. Under LINUX you can to start a virtual X windows Display server that is large enough to run a browser that shows the whole web site. This can be a VERY tall display. The browser is then run in it and set to fill the entire display. The web site is loaded and again grabs a screen shot. I have seen a script that can even automate that whole complex process. However you can end up with a VERY long image. It is also difficult to know just how big to make the display. Basically it is NOT easy and the best solutions only use IM for the final image processing, not the html to image generation.

          <h3>Raw RGB, and Gray Data</h3>Imagemagick has a some file formats for dealing with raw image data, specifically "<code>RGB:</code>", and "<code>GRAY:</code>". As well as provide settings defining that data. For example to output RGB raw data...
          <div align="center">
            <table class="table table-sm table-hover table-striped" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" width="90%" bgcolor="#F8F8F8">
              <tr>
                <td>
                  <pre><code>
  magick image.jpg -depth 8  image.rgb
</code></pre>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>
          </div>The "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?depth">-depth</a></code>" setting specifies the size of the integers written (and later read). In this case 8 bit values with 3 bytes per pixel for RGB, (a 24 bit image). Specifying an appropriate depth is always recomended for handlign raw image data. A "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?depth">-depth</a></code>" of 16 bits, will produce 2 bytes per value, in which case you may also need to specify the "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?endian">-endian</a></code>" or byte order, to be either '<code>MSB</code>' (most significate byte first), or '<code>LSB</code>' (least significate byte first, the default). Note that rgb is purely the image data, it does not even contain the width and the height of the image! Some applications 'assume' the data is a specific size, so you may need to use IM to ensure that data is this size. For example This resizes and pads the image to ensure it is 512x512 pixels in size.
          <div align="center">
            <table class="table table-sm table-hover table-striped" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" width="90%" bgcolor="#F8F8F8">
              <tr>
                <td>
                  <pre><code>
  magick image.jpg -resize \&gt;512x512 \
          -background black -gravity center -extent 512x512 \
          -depth 8  image.rgb
</code></pre>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>
          </div>When reading raw RGB (or GRAY) data into ImageMagick you will need to specify how big the image is. For example..
          <div align="center">
            <table class="table table-sm table-hover table-striped" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" width="90%" bgcolor="#F8F8F8">
              <tr>
                <td>
                  <pre><code>
  magick -size 512x512 -depth 8 image.rgb    image.png
</code></pre>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>
          </div>This will exactly define how much data Imagemagick will read in. Sometimes the raw data may have some extra header information attached. To allow IM to skip over this information you can specify an 'byte_offset' in the "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?size">-size</a></code>" setting. For example skip a 48 byte header...
          <div align="center">
            <table class="table table-sm table-hover table-striped" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" width="90%" bgcolor="#F8F8F8">
              <tr>
                <td>
                  <pre><code>
  magick -size 512x512+48 -depth 8 image.rgb    image.png
</code></pre>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>
          </div>This is the only time I know of where IM will make use of a third number in the "<code><a href="../option_link.cgi?size">-size</a></code>" setting. For more examples of using raw image data (grayscale) see the IM Discussion forum topic <a href="../forum_link.cgi?f=1&amp;t=20324&amp;p=80891">How to convert raw image to compressed tif?</a>.
          <h4>Floating Point Data</h4>
          <pre>You can also read (and write) RGB using normalized floating point numbers.
This however requires the use of special coder -define settings.
See HDRI floating point file formats
   https://imagemagick.org/Usage/basics/#hdri_formats


RGB floating point Image generated using C Code (HDRI)...

   float red = 1.0f;
   float green = 1.0f;   /* appropriate data */
   float blue = 1.0f;

   /* for exach pixel in image... */
   fwrite (&amp;red, sizeof(float), 1, file);
   fwrite (&amp;green, sizeof(float), 1, file);
   fwrite (&amp;blue, sizeof(float), 1, file);

Reading Options....

  magick -size 200x100 -depth 32 -define quantum:format=floating-point
          -define quantum:scale=65536.0   -endian lsb   input.rgb
          output.png

The quantum:format defines to read floating point numbers from the file.
While the -depth defines the floating point size (32 = floats, 64 = doubles).

The quantum:scale  defines how to scale the floating point numbers from
normalized 0.0 to 1.0 values to the in-memory 16bit Quality levels needed
by my Q16 version of IM.
